Alex Trebek's likely 'Jeopardy!' successor defends himself on allegations he mistreated colleagues,"At the same time, he is also confirming has been asked to ""consider hosting the show.""Richards, who is currently the executive producer of ""Jeopardy!,"" said ""no final decisions have been made"" about the next host. ""Discussions with me and other potential hosts are still ongoing,"" he wrote in an internal memo Monday morning.A spokesperson for Sony, the production company behind the game show, shared the memo.The appearance of Richards picking himself to succeed Alex Trebek has generated some backlash in the days since Variety first reported that he was in ""advanced negotiations"" to take over the show.Richards noted in his memo that ""the choice on this is not my decision and never has been.""Indeed, CNN Business reported last week that the ultimate decision-maker is Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment.""Throughout this search, Sony's top priority has always been to continue the incredible legacy you and Alex built,"" Richards wrote Monday. ""As you know, Alex always believed the game itself and the contestants are the most important aspects of the show, and that will continue to be the guiding principle as the decision is finalized.""The main thrust of Richards' memo was to counter recent stories about his reputation. The Daily Beast, for example, wrote last week that ""multiple women sued 'The Price Is Right' during Mike Richards' tenure as executive producer, and their stories paint an unsavory picture of Alex Trebek's presumptive successor.""One of the lawsuits alleged that Richards had a hostile reaction when one of the models on the game show, Brandi Cochran, became pregnant.Cochran sued in 2010. The case was eventually settled in 2016.  According to the lawsuit, when ""Cochran revealed that she was carrying twins,"" Richards ""put his face in his hands. He asked her twice, in an annoyed tone, 'Twins?  Are you serious? ... You're serious?' After that, Cochran was booked to work less often and was repeatedly taken out of acts she would have appeared in before.""Richards challenged those assertions and others on Monday. ""I want you all to know that the way in which my comments and actions have been characterized in these complaints does not reflect the reality of who I am or how we worked together on 'The Price is Right,'"" he wrote. ""I know firsthand how special it is to be a parent. It is the most important thing in the world to me. I would not say anything to disrespect anyone's pregnancy and have always supported my colleagues on their parenting journeys.""""Jeopardy!"" has been on the air this year with guest hosts in the wake of Trebek's death last November. Richards, who has years of past TV hosting experience, was one of the fill-ins, along with stars like Anderson Cooper, Robin Roberts and LeVar Burton.Joe Buck, the Fox Sports host, is guest-hosting this week, the final week of new episodes in this television season.Sony will need to appoint a new host very soon since the next season of ""Jeopardy!"" is about to enter production ahead of a September premiere date.Richards ended his memo by saying ""it is truly an honor to get to work with all of you to produce this amazing show, and I look forward to the days ahead as we get back into production.""",2021-08-09,media
"Big moves for oil, gold and bonds after blockbuster US jobs report","A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.How good? Yields on benchmark US 10-year bonds moved higher to roughly 1.3% after the jobs report on Friday, their highest level since July 23.Yields have since fallen back a bit. But the addition of 943,000 jobs in the United States is great news for the economy, making it more likely that the Federal Reserve begins to pull back its stimulus earlier than expected. Continued momentum toward an eventual rate hike could drive yields even higher over the coming months.""Friday's [jobs] data put Fed tapering back in the middle of the dinner table, sending US yields and the US Dollar higher,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.Another move: Gold prices crashed as much as 3.5% on Monday to $1,692.60 per ounce, before making a partial comeback. Silver also dropped.Some of the strength of that reaction was likely due to thin trading volumes when Asian markets opened on Monday. But the jobs report also played a part, because higher yields make gold less attractive.But that's not the whole story.While investors are looking ahead to the prospect of the Federal Reserve pulling back stimulus, they must also consider other risks including trade headwinds and the continued spread of the Delta variant.Over the weekend, trade data showed that export momentum eased in China in July, and could remain under pressure in the coming months. ""China's shipments are facing near-term headwinds from the recent spread of the coronavirus Delta variant and global supply-chain disruptions,"" wrote analysts at Oxford Economics.Delta is the biggest problem. While the United States is unlikely to return to strict lockdowns that crush growth, the variant is forcing companies across the country to rip up their plans for the rest of the year.And other countries could respond to Delta outbreaks with measures that take a bigger bite out of economic growth.""Pandemic nervousness will ... temper spirits, particularly in China, where a rapid spread of the Delta variant would be a game-changer for the region's recovery outlook,"" said Halley.For one concrete example of Delta nervousness, keep reading.Saudi Aramco profits increase 288%Crude oil prices have marched higher this year, boosting earnings at industry giants including BP, Shell and Exxon.So it's not surprise that Saudi Aramco, the massive producer controlled by Saudi Arabia, delivered a bumper second quarter. But, wow: Aramco's second quarter profit increased 288% over the same quarter last year to $25.5 billion. Profit for the first half of 2021 was $47.2 billion, roughly double the same period in 2020. ""Our second quarter results reflect a strong rebound in worldwide energy demand and we are heading into the second half of 2021 more resilient and more flexible, as the global recovery gains momentum,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement on Sunday. But, wait: Investors remain concerned about the Delta variant and weaker growth in China. On Monday, the price of Brent crude dropped as much as 3.8% before mounting a comeback.""What are disturbing oil markets the most ... is the Delta-variant Covid-19 strain which has vast swathes of the planet in its grip,"" said Halley.""That is increasing fears that the global recovery will stutter and become very uneven, thus reducing oil consumption even as OPEC+ continues to increase production,"" he added.Welcome to the metaverseFacebook has many pressing problems, from proposed antitrust legislation to accusations that the company is contributing to vaccine misinformation.But when CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined a recent conference call with analysts to discuss its latest quarterly results, much of the focus was on something far removed from those issues: the metaverse.How much focus? During the hour-long call, the metaverse was mentioned nearly two dozen times, reports my CNN Business colleague Clare Duffy.Metaverse primer: The metaverse was originally conceived as the setting for dystopian science fiction novels, where virtual universes provide an escape from crumbling societies. Now, the idea has transformed into a moonshot goal for Silicon Valley, and become a favorite talking point among startups, venture capitalists and tech giants.The idea is to create a space similar to the internet, but one that users (via digital avatars) can walk around inside of and where they can interact with one another in real time. In theory, you could, for example, sit around a virtual meeting table with colleagues from around the world — instead of staring at their 2D faces on Zoom — and then walk over to a virtual Starbucks to meet up with your mom, who lives across the country.Zuckerberg has in recent weeks been extolling his vision for turning Facebook into a ""metaverse company,"" claiming that he began thinking about the concept in middle school. The company recently announced the creation of a new metaverse product group and Zuckerberg said he sees the technology as ""the successor to the mobile internet.""Not just Facebook: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said recently that his company is working on building the ""enterprise metaverse."" Epic Games announced a $1 billion funding round in April to support its metaverse ambitions, pushing the Fortnite maker's valuation to nearly $30 billion. And in June, venture capitalist Matthew Ball helped launch an exchange traded fund so people can invest in the metaverse space, including companies like graphics chipmaker Nvidia and gaming platform Roblox.Up nextEarnings from Air Products, BioNTech, Dish Network and Tyson Foods are out before the opening bell.

Warren Buffett is buying more of his own stock as Berkshire profits surge,"Berkshire (BRKB) reported strong second quarter earnings on Saturday. Overall profits came in at $28.1 billion in the second quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago, And Berkshire's net income for the first half of 2021 hit $39.8 billion, reversing a $23.5 billion loss in the first six months of 2020.Operating profits, a measure that Buffett and many analysts and investors prefer to look at as a true measure of Berkshire's health, rebounded sharply as well. The company posted an operating profit of $6.7 billion in the second quarter, a 21% surge from a year ago.Yet Buffett, who has a net worth of nearly $105 billion, continues to be cautious. Berkshire has a giant pile of cash that is growing even bigger as Berkshire looks for more investing opportunities. The company had $144.1 billion on its balance sheet as of the end of June, up from $138.3 billion in December.Although Buffett is famous for making savvy investments in blue chip American companies like Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP), Berkshire has recently been splurging on its own stock. The company disclosed Saturday that it repurchased $6 billion of its shares in the second quarter. It has now bought back $12.6 billion in Berkshire stock so far this year. That's been a good investment as of late. Shares of Berkshire's more affordable B shares, which trade for around $285 and are in the S&P 500, are up 23% this year — outperforming the broader market. The company's A shares (BRKA), which do not split, trade for about $430,000 apiece.  Still, Buffett has long talked about wanting to do one more ""elephant-sized"" acquisition to broaden out the company's portfolio of assets. But make no mistake: Berkshire is doing just fine with what it already owns.Berkshire's railroad, utilities and energy businesses were a big winner in the second quarter, posting a 28% jump in operating earnings. Berkshire owns the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy utility companies.The company's ""other"" business unit, which includes a variety of consumer companies ranging from Dairy Queen and See's Candies to Duracell batteries, Benjamin Moore paints and Fruit of the Loom underwear. In a sign of how important these businesses are to Berkshire, the company announced in May that Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman in charge of the company's non-insurance operations, will succeed the soon to be 91-year old Buffett as Berkshire CEO once he either retires or passes away. Ajit Jain, another Berkshire vice chairman, runs the company's massive insurance unit, which includes auto and home insurance giant Geico. ",2021-08-09,investing
'The Suicide Squad' underperformed at the box office. Here's why,"So does that mean the film starring Idris Elba, John Cena and Margot Robbie as the devilishly crazy Harley Quinn was a flop? Not exactly.As we've seen so much this summer, it's getting increasingly difficult to gauge success at the box office. Theaters are still trying to find their footing after the pandemic ravaged their business, and offering blockbusters at home via streaming has skewed the metrics even further.That said, ""Suicide Squad"" is a big-budget superhero film by director James Gunn, who also directed Marvel's incredibly popular ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" His newest film also earned great reviews from critics (92% score on Rotten Tomatoes) and stars well-known actors, so box office expectations were high going into the weekend.But several factors may have dampened turnout. For starters, ""The Suicide Squad"" opened as concerns about rising Covid cases from the Delta variant are growing. Those fears may have scared some consumers away from wanting to sit indoors with strangers for two hours. But it's still too early to tell if the rise of the variant and the revived Covid restrictions — such as the CDC again recommending people wear masks indoors — had an impact.Another reason the film may have missed expectations is that it's a follow-up to 2016's ""Suicide Squad."" That film was poorly received by fans and critics alike, despite making $747 million globally, according to Comscore (SCOR). The 2021 film includes some of the same characters and actors from the 2016 version, and is less of a sequel and more of a second try. In the end, the sour response to the original film and confusion over this one's connection to it may have been a difficult sell for moviegoers.Finally, like all of Warner Bros. 2021 releases the film was also available on HBO Max the same day it hit theaters. That may have cannibalized ticket sales, but other recent Warner Bros. movies including ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" and ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" opened to solid numbers in theaters while also being available on HBO Max. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.)Although any one of these reasons could be to blame for the humdrum opening of ""The Suicide Squad,"" it's likely a mixture of all of the above.At the end of the day, it's not 2019 anymore, and the box office isn't the only way to judge if a film is a hit or not. Streaming is now the focus in Hollywood, so although the movie came in light at the box office, at least compared to the high expectations, it still could be considered a success for bringing attention — and possibly subscribers — to HBO Max. But without clear streaming viewership metrics, it's hard to say for sure.Now Hollywood and theaters look to the rest of the summer to see how the box office will do, how audiences will continue to react to the streaming revolution, and what effect, if any, the rise of the Delta variant will have on ticket sales overall.",2021-08-08,media
AMC says it'll soon let you pay for your movie ticket in bitcoin,"In an earnings call Monday, the theater chain announced that it would start rolling out technology to let moviegoers in the United States pay for their tickets and snacks in bitcoin (XBT) by the end of the year. ""I've had to learn more in the past six months about blockchain and cryptocurrency than I learned about it in the entire decade before that,"" said CEO Adam Aron. He added that the company was also ""exploring how else AMC (AMC) can participate in this new burgeoning cryptocurrency universe, and we're quite intrigued by potentially lucrative business [opportunities].""For now, the move would allow customers to buy tickets and concessions online using bitcoin for all of AMC's US theaters. Aron said that ""since we had to do the IT programming to accept bitcoin anyway, we are simultaneously writing the code right now to accept Apple Pay and Google Pay for online purchases at our US theaters also."" Investors cheered the news. AMC shares jumped 5.3% in after-hours trading. Bitcoin was up 5.5% Monday night from a day earlier.As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, a growing number of companies are exploring how to incorporate them in their businesses.Last month, virtual currencies soared after bullish comments from Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, the CEOs of Tesla (TSLA) and Twitter (TWTR), respectively.Musk had disclosed at the time that two of his companies — Tesla and SpaceX — both owned bitcoin, while Dorsey said that the cryptocurrency could become a major part of Twitter's strategy going forward.That week, news of an Amazon (AMZN) job posting also sent bitcoin surging. The company said it was recruiting for a ""digital currency and blockchain product lead,"" who would be expected to help its payments team develop ""new capabilities."" ""We're inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon,"" a spokesperson for the company told CNN Business at the time. ""We believe the future will be built on new technologies that enable modern, fast and inexpensive payments, and hope to bring that future to Amazon customers as soon as possible.""",2021-08-10,investing
Why big chains aren't requiring vaccines for customers ,"Representatives for retailers and restaurants and HR consultants who work with companies say it's too risky for frontline staff to be put in the position of enforcing vaccine rules for customers. Half of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and pockets of Americans remain resistant or fiercely opposed to getting the shots. There's also the risk that such requirements would alienate customers.Requiring customers to mask up throughout the pandemic has led to confrontations between customers who oppose mask wearing and store staff. Mandating vaccines would be even more challenging for businesses and jeopardize worker safety, industry trade groups say. Instead, large chains are taking different approaches. McDonald's (MCD) is requiring its workers to mask up in high-risk areas and that customers do so as well. Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others are requiring workers to wear masks but only recommending that customers do, too, in high-risk areas. Walmart, Walgreens (WBA) and Gap (GPS) are requiring corporate employees to be vaccinated as they seek to bring people back to the office, but not frontline staff in stores. Walmart, the largest private US employer, has said it hopes that requiring corporate staff to be vaccinated will convince more retail workers to get the shots.""We want to stick with the message that strongly encourages everybody to get vaccinated, but don't want to create a situation where employees basically have a risk of physical assault, because it happened last year,"" said Larry Lynch, senior vice president of science and industry for the National Restaurant Association. ""That's our biggest fear.""David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, doesn't believe vaccine mandates for customers are the ""right step"" for retail chains, and they would be unable to enforce such mandates.""Store employees are not trained to be security enforcement people,"" he said. ""What do you do if someone says they're coming in and not going to show their vaccination status?""No technology in placeThere are other barriers to vaccine requirements for customers aside from safety concerns, too. Most retail stores ""don't have any experience with requiring things like an ID to come into a store,"" French said, and it would hurt the quality of their customer service to be scrutinizing shoppers' vaccine status. There is no technology in place for retailers to easily check customers' vaccine status nationwide, he said. And then there's the question of what would happen if people forgot their vaccine cards at home or were accompanied by children who are not yet vaccinated.""There are some real practical problems with requiring vaccination status to enter a retail store,"" he said. ""It's something a lot of retailers are scratching their heads at.""Vaccine mandates for customers would also clash with some state and local rules, these industry groups say. Fourteen states have banned so-called vaccine passports — digital apps that allow users to show proof of vaccination before entering events and businesses — according to the National Academy for State Health Policy, a non-profit health policy organization which tracks such data.Companies' decisions on how to approach vaccine rules come as more businesses start to require vaccines for their workers and cities such as New York mandate them for customers to eat indoors and visit gyms. Some New York City restaurants are welcoming the new requirement. They hope that the measure will help avoid another shutdown, and are looking for support from the city to help them put it into place.But for the most part, it's easier for companies to set employment requirements for their own workforce than unfamiliar customers coming in every day, said Craig Rowley, senior client partner specializing in retail at executive search firm Korn Ferry.Public attitude on vaccine mandates for customers is sharply divided, another consideration for businesses.A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,290 adults from July 27 to August 2 found that 52% support requiring proof of vaccination for airline passengers, 49% support vaccine proof for attendees of large sports and entertainment events, and just 37% support proof for restaurant customers.""There are varying opinions on who should be required to prove they have had the vaccine. Yes on proof of vaccination for those who fly, a toss-up for people attending large events, and a no for people going to restaurants,"" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy.",2021-08-09,business
This is a first: The US has 10 million job openings,"That mismatch between worker demand and supply has been a defining characteristic of the pandemic recovery. Hiring is rampant across industries, as businesses are still rebuilding the capacity lost during last year's lockdowns. Professional and business services, retail, hotels and restaurants added the most job openings, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics report released Monday. But many jobless workers are facing complexities. Some continue to struggle with finding child care, while others are concerned about the risk of contracting the virus at work.""If we want to sustain our economic recovery, we have to get serious about removing barriers to filling these open jobs,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer of the US Chamber of Commerce. Specifically, Bradley added, ""that includes addressing childcare needs, rightsizing unemployment programs, skills training, and increasing legal immigration.""Economists expect that at least the child care aspect will be addressed when schools reopen in person after the summer. But the rampant spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant is adding exposure risk. Meanwhile, the generous pandemic-era unemployment benefits that have already ceased in multiple states will run out in September, which could affect the rate of hiring as well.Hires, layoffs and voluntary quitsIn June, the number of hires rose to 6.7 million, particularly due to increased activity in retail and education.The layoff rate was unchanged at 0.9%, the lowest level on record and flat from May, while the voluntary separation rate rose to 2.7%.The uptick in the quits rate is likely due ""in part to increased opportunities for workers to find better job matches, potentially with higher wages or safer working conditions in the lingering pandemic,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, in a tweet.The buoyant job openings report is further proof that America's employment recovery picked up speed over the summer months. Between June and July, the nation added nearly 1.9 million jobs.The unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in July and economists are getting more optimistic that it will reach pre-pandemic levels next year: Goldman Sachs (GS) predicts 3.5% unemployment by the end of 2022.That said, the overall jobless rate is just one measure of the labor market. Participation rates are still down and even though unemployment sank across most demographic groups in July, it remains higher for Black, Hispanic and Asian workers.",2021-08-09,economy
This company uses technology and nature to cut your air conditioning bill,"SkyCool Systems is trying to break that vicious cycle, using technology that promises to offer buildings an alternative means to cool down by essentially mimicking how the planet cools itself.""Our planet naturally cools itself by sending heat out in the form of infrared light or radiation,"" said Eli Goldstein, SkyCool's cofounder and CEO, through a process known as radiative cooling.""We're using that effect to essentially radiate heat out and out during the day and at night, even under direct sunlight."" The five-year-old company said it does this through rooftop panels made using nanotechnology. These panels consist of an optical film that radiates infrared light and cools itself in the process. They resemble solar panels but actually do the opposite, reflecting 97% of the sunlight that hits them and cooling the surface below, according to the company.SkyCool's model involves embedding a network of pipes below those panels. These pipes are filled with water, which is kept cool by the panels and then flows into a refrigeration or air conditioning system. This process is designed to take pressure off the system's cooling mechanism. And because the panels cool naturally and don't need external power to function, it helps the entire system use less electricity. A Grocery Outlet store in Stockton, California, which has been using SkyCool's system since last year, says it saw a marked drop in its electrical bills.""After we had our SkyCool system installed, our electricity company increased their rates on us,"" Jesus Valenzuela, the store manager, told CNN Business. ""We actually didn't see our bill go up at all. In fact, we saw it go just a little bit down,"" he added. Valenzuela estimates that the panels have saved his store roughly $3,000 a month.Scientists have been researching the benefits of radiative cooling for years, including Goldstein's co-founder and UCLA professor Aaswath Raman, who is a pioneer in the field. Several solutions and models to harness the process have been proposed in recent months.But there are some challenges, including a constraint familiar to the solar industry: it doesn't work as well without sunlight.""Our technology works best in hot, dry climates where the sky is clear, so when you have clouds, that blocks that radiative cooling window,"" Goldstein said. ""In the same way that [carbon dioxide] blocks light and sort of has that heat trapping effect, water vapor also will block infrared light."" But perhaps the biggest obstacle to making the technology ubiquitous is its relatively high cost. Most radiative cooling solutions ""suffer from a high manufacturing cost and large-scale production limits,"" researchers at China's Fudan University wrote in a paper published in the journal Nature earlier this year. Goldstein declined to reveal exactly how much SkyCool's panels cost but acknowledged that they are currently ""more expensive"" than solar panels.""New technologies like radiative cooling are often more expensive,"" he said. ""People are very sensitive to first cost, and so that is another barrier to getting new things out there.""Much of that is because of low production volumes, he said. Scaling up production could help bring the cost down, Goldstein said, particularly for developing countries in Asia and Africa where SkyCool hopes to eventually expand. For now, the company is focused on commercial applications of the technology, though it hopes to start installing panels on the roofs of individual homes. It has installed panels at other locations around California, including a retail store and a data center. ""We're just excited to be able to use this new technology for good,"" Goldstein said.",2021-08-09,tech
You might be able to retire earlier than you think. Here's how,"Financial Independence Retire Early -- or FIRE -- is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence and security as early as possible.""The mentality behind the movement is where one strives to live life on their own terms and to get off the proverbial hamster wheel where you are dependent on your employer and have the freedom and security to do so,"" said Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.   That could mean having the financial freedom to change careers, work less or travel the world. So what exactly does the FIRE movement entail? Here's everything you need to know.What is FIRE?The concept of FIRE is based on the notion that retirement is determined by a financial number and not by a person's age. It focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. That means usually saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of your annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt. ""FIRE involves a shift in perspective regarding money and work, prioritizing what is most important to your work-life balance, and making decisions not dictated by the need to earn money but the ultimate goal of financial freedom,"" said AnnaMarie Mock, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser for Highland Financial Advisors. People looking to pursue FIRE typically start by picking what's called a FIRE number, which is the amount of money you'd need to have saved to generate enough income to cover your expenses without having to work.To determine your FIRE number, start off by figuring out your yearly expenses, excluding savings and taxes. From there, calculate how much savings you'll need to generate that much income without having a paycheck. One rule of thumb, known as the 4% rule, says that retirees can safely withdraw about 4% of their savings a year without running out of money. That means saving 25 times your current annual expenses could last indefinitely with regular 4% yearly withdrawals.For example, if your annual expenses are $50,000 per year, you would need at least $1,250,000 ($50,000 x 25) saved when you retire. You can also take a more conservative approach by saving 28 to 33 times your current expenses, and take only 3% to 3.5% withdrawals. From there, try an online calculator to determine how much to save and when you can reach that early nest egg number. Starting as early as possible comes with many advantages. After all, getting a head start on your savings and investments gives your money more time to compound. But even though retiring early requires various sacrifices when it comes to saving and spending, the perks can be rewarding. ""The biggest perk of FIRE is independence,"" said Kevin Chancellor, a certified Social Security claiming strategist and financial adviser. ""If your budget is still sustainable then you have the freedom to travel, be involved in your kid's school activities, start a side business or hobby, and spend more time doing what you want to do rather than what you need to do.""Reaching the magic numberMany people think they don't earn enough to be able to retire early. But there are several methods of reaching FIRE that could help them retire faster than they think. When making the decision to retire early, you should expect to make some significant lifestyle changes. Those changes could be as big as increasing your streams of income or as small as cutting your own hair. It all comes down to either reducing how much you spend or boosting how much you save -- or both. ""Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,"" said Harrison. One way to do that is to drastically slash expenses and live a more frugal and lean lifestyle, which is often the quickest way to FIRE. Known as ""Lean FIRE,"" this typically means having a lower target number for your nest egg and living more modestly in retirement. Those who aren't interested in pinching pennies and have higher-than-average expenses can still retire by increasing their income.Some ways to achieve ""Fat FIRE,"" as it's known, could involve negotiating a higher salary, finding a higher paying job, accumulating sought-after skills, working a side-hustle or owning rental properties. Often, those pursuing Fat FIRE will either choose to work in higher paying professions or take longer to reach their larger savings goal.Some people who want to retire sooner can pursue another method often called ""Barista FIRE."" In this scenario, you can quit your full-time day job once you've stashed away enough retirement savings to grow into a nice nest egg in a few more years without having to add funds. But rather than ceasing work altogether, you work a part-time job, pursue a less lucrative dream career or take on freelance projects in order to cover basic living expenses, all the while allowing your long-term retirement savings to grow until a more traditional retirement age. Is FIRE right for me?Another thing to consider is how you'll spend your time without filling your days with a paid job. For example, will you pursue hobbies, volunteer or travel more? Without a plan in place, you might find that FIRE isn't all you'd hoped it would be.""For anyone retiring, it is important to know what you are retiring to. This is even more important for those looking to retire early,"" said Harrison. ""Figure out what is going to give your life meaning and purpose, so your retirement years can bring you joy.""",2021-08-09,business
DraftKings buys Golden Nugget Online Gaming for nearly $1.6 billion,"Shares of Golden Nugget Online Gaming skyrocketed nearly 50% on the news. The company is controlled by Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire owner of the Houston Rockets NBA team. The high-priced deal is the latest development in the rapid growth of the online gambling world. As more states legalize sports betting as well as online casino games such as poker and blackjack, companies like DraftKings are trying to attract gamblers of all types.DraftKings, which was trading flat on Monday, is not yet profitable. But the company is growing quickly, with second-quarter revenue surging nearly 300% from a year ago.Of course, the sports world was still largely in shutdown mode during the spring and early summer of 2020 due to Covid-19. But DraftKings also boosted its revenue outlook for the rest of 2021.DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in an interview with CNN Business that he thinks buying Golden Nugget Online Gaming will help increase the company's customer base and ""fills a meaningful hole for us.""The online gaming brand means more to older customers who are more frequent casino visitors and is also more popular with women, Robins said, while the average DraftKings bettor tends to be a younger man.""The Golden Nugget brand resonates more than DraftKings for the casino audience,"" Robins said, adding that DraftKings hopes to encourage Golden Nugget Online Gaming customers to try the company's core sports betting products. A ""golden"" age of gamblingAs part of the Golden Nugget deal, DraftKings will also work more closely with other parts of Fertitta's business empire, which includes the Landry's restaurant chain and brick and mortar Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.DraftKings will now have preferred pricing deals at sportsbooks in the Golden Nugget casinos that will reduce costs to operate sports betting operations there. The company also plans to open a new sportsbook in the Toyota Center, home of Fertitta's Houston Rockets, if Texas legalizes sports betting and allows teams to operate casinos. Fertitta, who owns about 46% of Golden Nugget Online Gaming's stock, has agreed to hold on to new DraftKings shares that will be issued as part of the deal for a minimum of one year following the closing of the merger, which could take place within the next four to six months.But Robins said Fertitta has told him he plans to be a long-term investor in DraftKings. To that end, Fertitta agreed to an all-stock transaction rather than including cash in the deal.The validation from Fertitta is a clear positive for DraftKings, which is looking to stand out in an increasingly competitive gambling market. Penn National Gaming (PENN)-backed Barstool Sports, FanDuel owner Flutter Entertainment (PDYPF) and casino giants MGM Resorts (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) are all making a bigger push to grab market share in the rapidly growing online betting world.

'Ignorance is a virus:' How local news outlets are reporting on Covid-19 vaccine rejection,"There is an old adage, sometimes attributed to Neil deGrasse Tyson, that ""ignorance is a virus."" It showed up on a protest sign in Los Angeles last month when a man sought to counter anti-vaccine demonstrators. His sign said ""Your ignorance is a virus. GET vaccinated!""I noticed the same sentiment on Twitter Monday afternoon, posted by former CNNer David Clinch, in response to a rage-inducing story about people who aren't willing to get a free Covid-19 vaccine, but are shelling out money for fake vaccine cards. ""Ignorance is a virus,"" Clinch wrote.Incomprehensible conspiracy theories, illogical memes, bogus ideas -- they all spread face to face and text to text in highly personal ways, and through wickedly viral platforms that spread nonsense from country to country in mere minutes. And we're all witnessing this spread in near real time due to the most recent Covid-19 surge in parts of the US. ""Arkansas has just 8 ICU beds available,"" ""Two Texas ERs temporarily shut down because of Covid,"" and ""DeSantis escalates war on masks in schools"" are three of the headlines on CNN.com right now.The unvaccinated are bearing the brunt of the pain and suffering. Disputes between vaccinated adults and unvaccinated adults increasingly have the feel of a death match, since this really is about life and death. Reporters are operating in the space between these two Americas and trying to explain one side to the other by interviewing vaccine opponents and the health care officials who are trying to help them. It can make for excruciating reading at times, but it's also incredibly informative...""We have failed""I have noticed that almost every front-line story cites America's information crisis and depressingly low levels of social trust: -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana: ""Somehow, we have failed our messaging,"" Dr. Frank Courmier told The Acadiana Advocate's Megan Wyatt as his hospital filled with critically ill patients. ""There seems to be a war over truth,"" he said. ""And I think that there is a brunt determination, for me at least, that truth will win, no matter how bleak it looks right now.""-- Long Island, New York: A 65-year-old man told Newsday's David Olson that ""I don't trust the government. Are you kidding me? What they did to Trump."" His equally vaccine-resistant wife said ""a relative of ours has told us they put aborted baby fetuses in the vaccine."" (False.) Olson also quoted a 71-year-old man who said he didn't ""know what to believe,"" but was ""reading and listening to the news about people who got the shot and they still get the COVID. To me, it's really not doing much.""-- San Antonio, Texas: The Express-News interviewed Victor Velos, ""a retired pulmonary specialist on the West Side,"" who is ""having a difficult time convincing his two youngest sons, in their mid-20s, to get the vaccine. The brothers get their information about vaccines from 4chan, an online forum that allows users to remain anonymous and where falsehoods about the vaccine have spread.""-- Tulare County, California: The Fresno Bee's story about a ""vaccination desert"" in California's Central Valley opened with a 29-year-old agricultural worker who ""knows many people, including his girlfriend, who have fallen ill to the virus. And in the past month alone, two of his friends died from complications related to the disease. Still, he hasn't made vaccination a priority, in part due to the misinformation about the shot he's read online.""-- Hyattsville, Maryland: Mike Brown, owner of The Shop Spa, told CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis that ""we have been trying to get the correct information to the community because they are swimming in pools of misinformation and they're buying it. So I'm enlightening them on the facts and making sure they get the correct information that can battle their conspiracy theories.""-- Boston, Massachusetts: ""Misinformation coming out of Haiti, which has the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rate of any country in the world,"" is having a particular impact on the Mattapan neighborhood, ""which has the largest Haitian community in the state,"" and the lowest vax rate in Boston, Tori Bedford reported for GBH.-- Far Rockaway, New York: In a neighborhood with low vaccination rates, community organizer Jazmine Outlaw said ""lack of information is why people miss out on things."" Plus, she told Politico's Téa Kvetenadze, people ""don't trust a lot of the information that's given out.""-- Heflin, Alabama: Ryan Jackson, a pharmacist, told the LA Times that he has heard all the conspiracy theories. But it's even deeper than that: ""They don't trust the government, a lot of political factors. It's just a complete distrust of everybody in authority."" But he's somewhat hopeful that ""more people will come around"" as the unvaxxed see that the vaccinated are ""not growing extra limbs and third eyeballs.""""I made that up. It's. Not. Real.""New York Times reporter Nicole Hong's story about ""one company's struggle to get all its employees vaccinated"" is having a longer lifespan than Hong could have expected.It's because of this paragraph about one reluctant employee at Metro Optics Eyewear in the Bronx: ""One employee said she was concerned because she thought a vaccine had caused the characters in the film 'I Am Legend' to turn into zombies. People opposed to vaccines have circulated that claim about the movie's plot widely on social media.""It really is a popular meme, believe it or not. On Monday, several days after Hong's story came out, one of the writers of ""I Am Legend"" chimed in. Akiva Goldsman, a co-writer and executive producer of the film, tweeted, ""Oh. My. God. It's a movie. I made that up. It's. Not. Real.""Meet ""the Tucker Carlson fans who got vaxxed""Olga Khazan of The Atlantic asked more than a dozen ""vaccinated fans of the Fox News host,"" mostly IDed via Twitter, about ""what it will take to get more Republicans to get their shots."" Khazan said ""one factor seemed to have played the biggest role in my interviewees' decision to get vaccinated: a genuine fear of Covid-19."" She concluded that ""a strategy based on fear"" might make sense...""How can we help?""Laurie Garrett, the acclaimed science reporter, pointed out on Monday that ""the internet is blowing up with stories like these"" -- stories about vaccine skeptics, sometimes outright opponents, who wind up dying as a result of the virus. She linked to a Slate story about Dick Farrel, a right-wing radio host in Florida who died last week, and a CNN story about six members of a Florida church who died in recent weeks.Garrett said that ""liberals respond"" to the stories ""with snide, superior comments -- a 'serves 'em right' attitude. But we won't stop #COVID19 unless we express compassion. Why were they misled? How can we help?""Recommended reads-- Ray A.

It's official: Cryptocurrency is infrastructure,"The breakthrough is significant for two reasons: 1) Negotiators were able to reach a bipartisan consensus. 2) It deals with a largely new industry, which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.A lead negotiator, Sen. Pat Toomey, put it more bluntly on Monday, describing cryptocurrency as ""an issue that has been vexing us."" Another lead negotiator, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, called it ""such a new subject to so many people in the US Senate.""The Senate's average age is 64.3 years -- older than the House's 58.4 years, according to the Library of Congress. And among US investors over 50, 76% say they haven't even heard of cryptocurrencies, according to a recent Gallup poll.A last-minute cryptocurrency tax provision was tacked on to the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill last week, which complicated infrastructure negotiations as a bitter dispute emerged over proposed tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions. It also prompted a sharp public outcry over the item's initial language. On Monday, Toomey and Lummis announced an amendment to the provision, negotiated with the Treasury Department, focused on regulating digital assets by requiring brokers to report their transactions.The negotiating group also included Sens. Rob Portman, a Republican, and Democrats Mark Warner and Kyrsten Sinema. ""The silver lining is we found out who in the Senate is interested in this subject who maybe previously didn't know anything about"" cryptocurrencies, Lummis said. The Wyoming Republican added: ""We were finally able to illustrate that there's a lot of people interested in digital assets and now have contact with their senator.""American investors already are showing increasing interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Among adults with $10,000 or more invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, either within or outside retirement funds, 6% say they own Bitcoin, according to the same recent Gallup poll. That's up from just 2% who said the same in May 2018. That number climbs even higher, to 13%, for investors under 50 years old.Gallup likens current Bitcoin ownership levels to gold, which 11% of investors say they own.Lummis acknowledged the ""space is moving so fast, the innovation is working at such a rapid rate that we will probably have to revisit this subject,"" and called the amendment ""legislation that sets some definitions in this space.""The Point: Bipartisan negotiators took on the largely new-to-them frontier of cryptocurrency and made a deal -- expanding our definition of ""infrastructure"" once again to keep up with the times.",2021-08-09,politics
Domino's is giving away $50 million of free food to take on DoorDash,"The pizza chain announced Monday a ""Surprise Frees"" promotion, giving customers a chance for some free food to counter delivery apps like UberEats and DoorDash. Domino's called competitors' extra fees a ""disappointing surprise.""""Other food delivery apps charge customers with hidden city or service fees,"" Domino's (DPZ) said on its website. ""Not Domino's. We charge customers one straightforward delivery fee because we believe that level of transparency is what customers want and deserve."" Lucky Domino's customers who order on the company's website now through November 21 could get an added menu item at no additional cost, including pizza, cheesy bread or chocolate lava cakes. Domino's said the free food will be added to one in every 14 orders, giving customers a little more than a 7% chance of winning each time they order. Winners will see the additional menu item on their order confirmation page.UberEats, DoorDash and other food delivery apps have angered some customers for adding fees in some US cities just before checkout. The added charges are the result of local governments pausing caps that limit how much third-party delivery platforms can charge restaurants in an effort to help struggling businesses. DoorDash has added a roughly $1 to $2 delivery charge in several US cities, including Chicago, Cleveland and Denver. UberEats has charged a similar customer fee in Portland, Chicago, Minneapolis and Boston.In the United States, Domino's has long resisted offering deliveries through third-party apps. In a February earnings call, Domino's CEO Richard Allison said the company ""struggled a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator businesses,"" and that it ""doesn't make sense economically"" for franchisees to use the apps. ""In 60 years, we've never made a dollar delivering a pizza. We make money on the product, but we don't make money on the delivery,"" Allison said on the call. ""So, we're just not sure how others do it.""The free food offer may also offset some concerns from Domino's customers who are now waiting longer for their deliveries. Allison recently said that delivery times have ""slipped a minute or two"" because of staffing challenges. To help address the issue, Domino's is raising wages, a tactic that has helped some restaurant chains attract employees.--CNN Business' Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.",2021-08-09,business
Why Silicon Valley is betting on making this dystopian sci-fi idea a reality,"The metaverse was originally conceived as the setting for dystopian science fiction novels, where virtual universes provide an escape from crumbling societies. Now, the idea has transformed into a moonshot goal for Silicon Valley, and become a favorite talking point among startups, venture capitalists and tech giants.The idea is to create a space similar to the internet, but one that users (via digital avatars) can walk around inside of and where they can interact with one another in real time. In theory, you could, for example, sit around a virtual meeting table with colleagues from around the world — instead of staring at their 2D faces on Zoom — and then walk over to a virtual Starbucks to meet up with your mom, who lives across the country.  Zuckerberg has in recent weeks been extolling his vision for turning Facebook (FB) into a ""metaverse company,"" claiming that he began thinking about the concept in middle school. The company recently announced the creation of a new metaverse product group and Zuckerberg said he sees the technology as ""the successor to the mobile internet.""Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said last week that his company is working on building the ""enterprise metaverse."" Epic Games announced a $1 billion funding round in April to support its metaverse ambitions, pushing the Fortnite maker's valuation to nearly $30 billion. And in June, venture capitalist Matthew Ball helped launch an exchange traded fund so people can invest in the metaverse space, including companies like graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and gaming platform Roblox (RBLX). Despite the current hype cycle, the idea is still amorphous, and a fully functioning metaverse is probably years and billions of dollars away — if it happens at all. Big companies joining the discussion now may simply want to reassure investors that they won't miss out on what could be the next big thing, or that their investments in VR, which has yet to gain broad commercial appeal, will eventually pay off. And, especially in Facebook's case, playing up the long-term potential for the metaverse could be a useful way of distracting from growing scrutiny in the here and now.Whatever the motivations, big questions remain, from how tech companies may handle safety and privacy issues in the metaverse to whether people really want to live much of their lives inside an immersive virtual simulation.""My biggest concern about the metaverse is: Are we ready?"" said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens. ""Are we emotionally evolved enough yet to move beyond the safe division of having screens between us and typing words?"" he said. ""Are we safe to start interacting at a more person-to-person level, or are the a**holes still going to ruin it for everybody?"" What is the ""metaverse""?The ""metaverse"" was coined in the 1992 cyberpunk novel ""Snow Crash."" In the book, main character Hiro Protagonist — a hacker and, for a short time, pizza deliverer — uses the metaverse as an escape from his life, in which he lives with a roommate in a 20-by-30-foot storage container in a bleak world where the government has been replaced by corrupt corporations. In that story, the metaverse is a platform for virtual creation, but it's also rife with problems, including technology addiction, discrimination, harassment and violence, which occasionally spill over into the real world.That's a far cry from the optimistic potential that Zuckerberg and others have presented. But one sign that the metaverse is still far off: No one can quite agree on a clear definition of what it is, or could be.Experts working in the space tend to agree on a few key aspects of the metaverse, including the idea that users will experience a sense of ""embodiment"" or ""presence."" That is, they'll feel like they're actually inside a virtual space with other people, seeing things in first-person and probably 3D. It will also be able to host many users who can interact with one another in real time.  ""You can kind of think about [the metaverse] as an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.Much like the internet today, the metaverse won't be a single technology that gets switched on at once, but rather an ecosystem built over time by many different companies using a variety of technologies. Ideally, those various parts of the ecosystem will be interconnected and interoperable, said Jesse Alton, a leader at Open Metaverse, a group developing open source standards for the metaverse.""Someone who's playing a video game could win a flaming sword in their favorite game on Xbox, put it in their inventory, and later in VR, they can show it to their friend and their friend can hold it,"" said Alton, who is also the founder of extended reality firm AngellXR. ""It's the ability to transport [information] from one world to another, regardless of which platform it's in."" Some pieces of the metaverse already exist. Services like Fortnite, an online game in which users can compete, socialize and build virtual worlds with millions of other players, can give users an early sense of how it will work. And some people have already spent thousands of dollars on virtual homes, staking out their piece of metaverse real estate. Why is everyone suddenly talking about it? The metaverse is a relatively old idea that seems to gain momentum every few years, only to fade from the conversation in lieu of more immediate opportunities. Perhaps predictably, those working on this technology see signs that this time could be different.""A lot of the folks that were working on it before ... are still involved, it's just that we've been waiting for certain technological advancements,"" Alton said. Improvements in mobile device processors, gaming systems, internet infrastructure, virtual reality headsets and cryptocurrency are all crucial building blocks for creating the metaverse and ensuring consumer adoption. What's more, after the pandemic forced much of the world to work, learn and socialize from home, many people may feel more comfortable interacting virtually than they did two years ago, something tech companies may be trying to capitalize on. ""[A change like] this is always a multi-decade, iterative process ... and yet, despite that fact, there is an unmistakable sense over the past few years that the foundational pieces are coming together in a way that feels very new and very different,"" Ball, the venture capitalist, said. Will the metaverse have the same problems as the internet? Proponents of the metaverse say there could eventually be huge business potential — a whole new platform on which to sell digital goods and services. It could also have benefits for how humans interact using technology.""What we're really doing is figuring out ways to add technology into our lives to make our lives better and to enhance our communication with other people,"" RealityPrime's Bar-Zeev said. ""It's not just about conquering a whole new world."" But there are also a host of concerns about how the metaverse could be used or exploited. Zuckerberg said last week that advertisements will likely be a key source of revenue in the metaverse, just as they are for the company today. But some in the space worry that an ad-based business model will create haves, who can afford to pay for an ad-free headset or metaverse experience, and have-nots who can't, replicating inequalities present in the real world.""I don't want to see a world in which we segregate people into those who can afford it get a better experience and those who can't afford it have this crappy experience of being exploited for advertising,"" Bar-Zeev said. He added that online harassment could become more intense when users can assault each others' virtual bodies, rather than just trading ugly words on a screen. Data privacy and security could also become greater concerns when ""more of our lives, our data, our labor, our investments now exist in purely virtual form,"" Ball said. And other issues, such as misinformation and radicalization, could worsen in the metaverse, too.""If you can now replace somebody's entire reality with an alternate reality, you can make them believe almost anything,"" Bar-Zeev said. ""The responsibility of everybody in the field is to prevent the bad things as much as possible and foster the good things.""",2021-08-08,tech
Big Oil wants to keep drilling in the North Sea. The backlash is growing,"In the coming weeks, Britain's oil regulator could decide whether to green-light the Cambo development near the Shetland Islands, which co-owners Shell (RDSA) and Blackstone-backed Siccar Point Energy expect to produce 164 million barrels of crude during the first phase of development.But environmental groups and other activists are furious. They claim that approving the development would damage the environment and undermine claims by the UK government that it's taking bold action ahead of November's 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow.""We will know if politicians are listening if the UK government, as hosts of COP who aspire to lead on climate, call time and put a stop to Cambo,"" said Tessa Khan, a climate lawyer who leads the advocacy group Uplift.The political fight underscores the challenges facing governments and businesses as they strive to meet net-zero emissions goals aimed at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is essential to maintaining a livable planet. On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees. Yet the world remains reliant on oil and gas, and companies like Shell are working to provide it. To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, however, no new oil or gas fields can be approved for development, the International Energy Agency warned earlier this year.""If we reduce the consumption of oil in line with what is needed to reach [the 2050] targets, we will not need to invest in new oil or gas exploration or new coal mining. Very clear,"" Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a recent interview on Cambo with the UK's Channel 4. The UK government, he added, should choose to be an ""inspiration for the rest of the world.""The Cambo oilfieldThe Cambo oilfield is a key project for Shell, which holds a 30% stake, and Siccar Point, which controls 70% of the venture.""It'll be important for both of them because there are so few developments now [in the North Sea],"" said Alexander Kemp, a professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen.Discovered in 2002, the field could contain over 800 million barrels of heavy crude. Deepwater drilling is expected to start in 2022, with oil production kicking off in 2025 and running until 2050.""It's a significant size field by today's standards,"" said Kemp, noting that a more typical development would yield about 20 million barrels, not 164 million. But the project has stoked the ire of a coalition of environmental advocates, who are ramping up political pressure by highlighting the optics of approving the development so close to COP26. The oil produced will have the same climate footprint as running about 18 coal-fired power stations for a year, Uplift has calculated.""The proposed new Cambo oilfield is a clear climate contradiction,"" Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said in a statement this month. ""If the UK government is to be a credible broker for a deal that can stop the planet overheating when it hosts the COP26 climate talks in November it must intervene in the Cambo case.""The IEA's net-zero roadmap published in May is another flash point. The report plainly states that as of 2021, no new oil and gas fields can be developed in order to reach climate targets. Uplift's Khan said this is ""the first major test"" since the warning was issued.A looming decisionThe UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is expected to imminently decide whether to allow the development to proceed.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told local media late last week that the choice is up to the regulator and ""no contracts should be ripped up."" Greenpeace has said if the OGA moves ahead, it could sue. The activist group takes particular issue with the government's announcement that it will require new ""climate compatibility checkpoints"" on future oil and gas licensing rounds to make sure they're in line with the United Kingdom's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. That doesn't apply to Cambo, since a license was already issued in 2001 when exploration of the area began. Greenpeace has called this a deliberate ""loophole.""Alok Sharma, the lawmaker appointed by the UK government to lead COP26, did not directly address whether North Sea oil production contradicts UK climate goals when asked by reporters Monday, saying that the government was ""going to be very rigorously applying a climate compatibility check"" for ""future"" oil and gas licenses.There's reason to believe the OGA will push forward with the project, even if it generates backlash.The agency has emphasized that even under net-zero plans, oil and gas will remain crucial sources of energy for the country, and that it's closely monitoring emissions for all projects to make sure they align with the 2050 goal.""Oil and gas still make up around three quarters of the UK's energy consumption,"" Chairman Tim Eggar wrote in the agency's latest annual report. ""They are forecast to be needed now and into the future; not just for heating, transport and power generation, but also as a feedstock for manufacturing other materials such as chemicals, medicines and more.""Shell and Siccar Point's roleThis position is echoed by those in the oil industry who believe that based on the United Kingdom's ongoing energy requirements, the focus on Cambo is overdone.""Fields like Cambo meet the UK's energy needs, and producing it here means we can reduce emissions associated with production as much as possible,"" said Deirdre Michie, CEO of industry group Oil & Gas UK. ""A premature ending of domestic production would mean we simply need to import more of it from other countries, at great expense, while losing all control of the environmental standards for how it was produced.""In response to questions from CNN Business, Siccar Point Energy CEO Jonathan Roger said that Cambo would directly create 1,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, and that the oilfield will be built using ""modern, low-emission equipment and manufacturing processes and be electrification ready, with the potential to be powered by renewable energy when that's feasible.""Shell emphasized that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is expected to continue to decline until 2030.""We're already investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy,"" a company spokesperson said. ""But the world will still need oil and gas for decades to come in sectors that can't be easily decarbonized. Targeted investment in oil and gas will ensure we can supply the energy people will still rely on, while funding the rapid growth of our low-carbon businesses.""But like the UK government, industry players are walking a tightrope.There are, of course, business considerations at play. The United Kingdom is one of nine core markets that Shell has identified for energy exploration and production. In a report to investors, the Anglo-Dutch company estimated average investment returns of 20% to 25% for similar projects across its portfolio. Siccar Point said investment in the Cambo project will total about £1.9 billion ($2.6 billion) and £140 million ($194 million) has already been put up. It declined to comment on expected returns.Meanwhile, investors are asking more from oil companies as they increasingly weigh environmental and social concerns — as are the courts.In May, a Dutch judge ordered Shell to slash its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels in a landmark climate decision. That would require the company, which is currently targeting a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2035, to speed up its transition plan.Shell is appealing the ruling, which it says risks shifting demand to suppliers that are less concerned about reducing their emissions impact. But the Cambo debate reveals the firm's tough road ahead. On one hand, Shell wants to drum up confidence in plans to make its business greener. And yet, at its core, it's still a corporation that produces oil and gas. That's not going to change anytime soon.",2021-08-10,energy
