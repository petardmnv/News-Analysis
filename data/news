Alibaba fires employee accused of sexual assault as pressure mounts on Chinese tech,"The company on Monday said it has fired an employee after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who also works at Alibaba (BABA). The man confessed to actions that Alibaba deemed ""in serious violation of company policy,"" according to a memo sent by Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang to employees.Two senior employees also resigned after they ""failed to prioritize employee protection,"" according to Zhang's memo.""Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba's top priority,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business.The allegations — which were widely circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend — have rocked Alibaba at a time when it and other Chinese tech companies are already facing incredible scrutiny from Chinese regulators over their business. The claims triggered public outcry as many criticized the company for its handling of the situation. The controversy started after a post — allegedly written by the victim, who did not identify herself, and published on an internal Alibaba website — circulated on the Chinese social media website Weibo. According to screenshots of the 8,000-word account, the woman claimed she was assaulted by her supervisor during a business trip to Jinan, a city in eastern China, while she says she was drunk. ""The male leader even entered my hotel room four times that night with condom and assaulted me!!!! When I typed the lines above, I couldn't control myself, and I broke into tears. I never thought that I would have such an experience,"" she wrote. ""When I think about it now, it just feels like a nightmare, one that makes you terrified, scared, helpless, helpless nightmare!""CNN Business cannot confirm the authenticity of the post.The post has exploded on Chinese social media. Topics related to the incident have been viewed 850 million times on Weibo, generating more than 510,000 discussion posts. Some commenters accused Alibaba of failing to protect the rights of its employees. The woman allegedly claimed that the company brushed off her concerns when she reported them.""How come there are still female employees who have been pushed and pressured by their leaders to drink and are violated. Is this the Alibaba culture?"" wrote one Weibo user. ""I really hope the results of the investigation can become clear as soon as possible. Such a large company must protect its employees.""On Sunday, police in Jinan announced on Weibo that they had launched a probe into the case.""The police are actively investigating the matter and collecting evidence,"" they said in a statement. The accused has not been charged with any crime. In the memo to employees on Monday, Zhang said the employee confessed to ""intimate acts"" with a woman who was inebriated, violating company policy. ""Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement,"" Zhang added in the memo, which was posted publicly on the company's news website. ""He will be fired and never be rehired,"" Zhang wrote. Two executives, including the president of Alibaba's Neighborhood Retail group, have resigned over the handling of the incident, according to Zhang, who added that the woman reported the incident to the company August 2. ""We believe that the head of the business is both the owner of the business and the team's culture,"" Zhang wrote, adding that when the woman reported ""a horrendous act ... they did not make timely decisions nor took appropriate action.""""This incident has caused tremendous harm to her. We will do everything we can to take care of her,"" Zhang wrote.Zhang added that the company's chief people officer has also been reprimanded, and said that the company will establish a dedicated reporting channel for employees, as well as create an ""anti-sexual harassment policy"" that will include input from experts and employees. Zhang also acknowledged that the incident highlights what he called a culture of ""forced drinking,"" referring to alcohol-heavy events that are popular in China to secure business deals or build partnerships.  ""Although the police are still investigating the specific circumstances of the dinner that day, we are staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture,"" he wrote. ""Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or a supervisor, our employees are empowered to reject it.""The scandal's rapid spread on social media — along with the public outrage that ensued — comes as major firms, including Alibaba, have faced huge regulatory pressure. As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party's dominant role in every aspect of China's economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions.Complaints about work culture play into that scrutiny. Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm and rival to Alibaba, faced intense public backlash earlier this year  over accusations that it overworks its employees after two of its employees died unexpectedly, including a man who died by suicide. Chinese social media users started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture, and a former software engineer at the company escalated criticisms in several posts where he accused the company of overworking its employees. The company did not respond at the time to questions about the allegations made against its work culture, but did say that it had set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of a worker.",2021-08-09,tech,CNN
Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for one week,"Greene tweeted on Monday that the Food and Drug Administration ""should not approve the covid vaccines."" She also claimed the vaccines were ""failing"" and that they were ineffective at reducing the virus's spread. In response, Twitter labeled the tweet as misleading and prevented Greene from tweeting for one week. The tweet, a company spokesperson said, ""was labeled in line with our COVID-19 misleading information policy. The account will be in read-only mode for a week due to repeated violations of the Twitter Rules.""Tuesday's suspension marks at least the third and toughest penalty Twitter has imposed on Greene for sharing misinformation. In January, Greene was suspended for 12 hours from Twitter for sharing conspiracy theories about the Georgia Senate runoff elections, a move that the company said violated its civic integrity policy. In July, Twitter suspended Greene again for 12 hours for sharing misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. (Greene was also temporarily suspended in March but was soon reinstated after Twitter said its automated systems had acted in error.)According to Twitter's Covid-19 misinformation policy, users can receive a one-week suspension if they violate that policy four times. Violating the Covid-19 policy five or more times can result in a permanent ban. Twitter declined to say how many times Greene has violated the company's rules.",2021-08-10,tech,CNN
Why Silicon Valley is betting on making this dystopian sci-fi idea a reality,"The metaverse was originally conceived as the setting for dystopian science fiction novels, where virtual universes provide an escape from crumbling societies. Now, the idea has transformed into a moonshot goal for Silicon Valley, and become a favorite talking point among startups, venture capitalists and tech giants.The idea is to create a space similar to the internet, but one that users (via digital avatars) can walk around inside of and where they can interact with one another in real time. In theory, you could, for example, sit around a virtual meeting table with colleagues from around the world — instead of staring at their 2D faces on Zoom — and then walk over to a virtual Starbucks to meet up with your mom, who lives across the country.  Zuckerberg has in recent weeks been extolling his vision for turning Facebook (FB) into a ""metaverse company,"" claiming that he began thinking about the concept in middle school. The company recently announced the creation of a new metaverse product group and Zuckerberg said he sees the technology as ""the successor to the mobile internet.""Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said last week that his company is working on building the ""enterprise metaverse."" Epic Games announced a $1 billion funding round in April to support its metaverse ambitions, pushing the Fortnite maker's valuation to nearly $30 billion. And in June, venture capitalist Matthew Ball helped launch an exchange traded fund so people can invest in the metaverse space, including companies like graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and gaming platform Roblox (RBLX). Despite the current hype cycle, the idea is still amorphous, and a fully functioning metaverse is probably years and billions of dollars away — if it happens at all. Big companies joining the discussion now may simply want to reassure investors that they won't miss out on what could be the next big thing, or that their investments in VR, which has yet to gain broad commercial appeal, will eventually pay off. And, especially in Facebook's case, playing up the long-term potential for the metaverse could be a useful way of distracting from growing scrutiny in the here and now.Whatever the motivations, big questions remain, from how tech companies may handle safety and privacy issues in the metaverse to whether people really want to live much of their lives inside an immersive virtual simulation.""My biggest concern about the metaverse is: Are we ready?"" said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens. ""Are we emotionally evolved enough yet to move beyond the safe division of having screens between us and typing words?"" he said. ""Are we safe to start interacting at a more person-to-person level, or are the a**holes still going to ruin it for everybody?"" What is the ""metaverse""?The ""metaverse"" was coined in the 1992 cyberpunk novel ""Snow Crash."" In the book, main character Hiro Protagonist — a hacker and, for a short time, pizza deliverer — uses the metaverse as an escape from his life, in which he lives with a roommate in a 20-by-30-foot storage container in a bleak world where the government has been replaced by corrupt corporations. In that story, the metaverse is a platform for virtual creation, but it's also rife with problems, including technology addiction, discrimination, harassment and violence, which occasionally spill over into the real world.That's a far cry from the optimistic potential that Zuckerberg and others have presented. But one sign that the metaverse is still far off: No one can quite agree on a clear definition of what it is, or could be.Experts working in the space tend to agree on a few key aspects of the metaverse, including the idea that users will experience a sense of ""embodiment"" or ""presence."" That is, they'll feel like they're actually inside a virtual space with other people, seeing things in first-person and probably 3D. It will also be able to host many users who can interact with one another in real time.  ""You can kind of think about [the metaverse] as an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.Much like the internet today, the metaverse won't be a single technology that gets switched on at once, but rather an ecosystem built over time by many different companies using a variety of technologies. Ideally, those various parts of the ecosystem will be interconnected and interoperable, said Jesse Alton, a leader at Open Metaverse, a group developing open source standards for the metaverse.""Someone who's playing a video game could win a flaming sword in their favorite game on Xbox, put it in their inventory, and later in VR, they can show it to their friend and their friend can hold it,"" said Alton, who is also the founder of extended reality firm AngellXR. ""It's the ability to transport [information] from one world to another, regardless of which platform it's in."" Some pieces of the metaverse already exist. Services like Fortnite, an online game in which users can compete, socialize and build virtual worlds with millions of other players, can give users an early sense of how it will work. And some people have already spent thousands of dollars on virtual homes, staking out their piece of metaverse real estate. Why is everyone suddenly talking about it? The metaverse is a relatively old idea that seems to gain momentum every few years, only to fade from the conversation in lieu of more immediate opportunities. Perhaps predictably, those working on this technology see signs that this time could be different.""A lot of the folks that were working on it before ... are still involved, it's just that we've been waiting for certain technological advancements,"" Alton said. Improvements in mobile device processors, gaming systems, internet infrastructure, virtual reality headsets and cryptocurrency are all crucial building blocks for creating the metaverse and ensuring consumer adoption. What's more, after the pandemic forced much of the world to work, learn and socialize from home, many people may feel more comfortable interacting virtually than they did two years ago, something tech companies may be trying to capitalize on. ""[A change like] this is always a multi-decade, iterative process ... and yet, despite that fact, there is an unmistakable sense over the past few years that the foundational pieces are coming together in a way that feels very new and very different,"" Ball, the venture capitalist, said. Will the metaverse have the same problems as the internet? Proponents of the metaverse say there could eventually be huge business potential — a whole new platform on which to sell digital goods and services. It could also have benefits for how humans interact using technology.""What we're really doing is figuring out ways to add technology into our lives to make our lives better and to enhance our communication with other people,"" RealityPrime's Bar-Zeev said. ""It's not just about conquering a whole new world."" But there are also a host of concerns about how the metaverse could be used or exploited. Zuckerberg said last week that advertisements will likely be a key source of revenue in the metaverse, just as they are for the company today. But some in the space worry that an ad-based business model will create haves, who can afford to pay for an ad-free headset or metaverse experience, and have-nots who can't, replicating inequalities present in the real world.""I don't want to see a world in which we segregate people into those who can afford it get a better experience and those who can't afford it have this crappy experience of being exploited for advertising,"" Bar-Zeev said. He added that online harassment could become more intense when users can assault each others' virtual bodies, rather than just trading ugly words on a screen. Data privacy and security could also become greater concerns when ""more of our lives, our data, our labor, our investments now exist in purely virtual form,"" Ball said. And other issues, such as misinformation and radicalization, could worsen in the metaverse, too.""If you can now replace somebody's entire reality with an alternate reality, you can make them believe almost anything,"" Bar-Zeev said. ""The responsibility of everybody in the field is to prevent the bad things as much as possible and foster the good things.""",2021-08-08,tech,CNN
AMC is playing to the Reddit crowd,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.The latest: On the company's earnings call Monday, Aron made it very clear through his choice of words — and downright flattery — that he views retail investors as crucial to the movie theater chain's fortunes.It's not altogether surprising, given that AMC — which had to close all of its cinemas during the peak of the pandemic last year — has been a major beneficiary of the meme stock phenomenon, in which retail investors pour billions of dollars into often troubled companies.The company posted a loss for the three months ended June, but it was narrower than analysts expected and revenue came in ahead of forecasts.""In short, AMC crushed it in Q2,"" Aron said on the call, adopting the Reddit crowd's lingo. Later, Aron highlighted the fact that AMC has implemented some of the ""great ideas"" that individual investors have ""showered"" it with, including screening professional sporting events and concerts.He answered around a dozen questions submitted by individual investors. ""Can you guys make the AMC mascot officially a gorilla?,"" Aaron asked, reflecting the tendency of Reddit investors to refer to each other as ""apes."" ""Would AMC ever consider reestablishing drive-in theaters?,"" Ryan wanted to know.By comparison, Aron took questions from just one analyst — down from about six a year ago — blaming time constraints for cutting it short.The reaction: The stock gained Monday and is up nearly 9% premarket. AMC's newest shareholders raved about Aron's performance on social media platforms such as Reddit afterwards. ""Silverback Adam crushed the earnings call. If you're ""in this to win this"", you should listen to it,"" wrote one observer on Twitter.What it means: Individual investors matter and companies are embracing them for good reason.AMC's stock is up over 1,500% so far this year and it was able to raise $587 million in June as meme traders piled in, even though none of the analysts who cover the company recommend buying the stock and theater attendance remains way below pre-pandemic levels.Watch this space: Playing to another online crowd favorite, AMC announced that it would start rolling out technology to let moviegoers in the United States pay for their tickets and snacks in bitcoin by the end of the year.It is also buying up American theaters and plans to open about a dozen new venues in the United States, Europe and the Middle East this year, betting that consumers will return to the movies once the pandemic subsides.""We fundamentally believe that ours is a future that is bright because there is nothing as magical as seeing dazzling images on a huge silver screen,"" Aron said on the call.Companies have nowhere to hide on climateBusinesses that don't have a plan in place to cut their carbon emissions may soon find themselves on the receiving end of shareholder revolts.What's happening: On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees — a critical threshold with dire global consequences.The shocking assessment will only increase pressure on companies to scale up climate action in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.""The science is crystal clear but the response is not. Investors must use their influence to push decision makers to make the bold emission reductions required to limit the most severe consequences of climate change,"" Wai-Shin Chan, global head of environmental, social and governance research at HSBC (HSBC), told Reuters.See here: In one of the latest signs of the growing backlash that polluters face, Greenpeace is threatening to sue if Britain green-lights a new crude oil development in the North Sea.The project is co-owned by Siccar Point Energy and Shell (RDSB), which is trying to drum up confidence among shareholders in its plan to make its business greener.

People pursuing this goal start by picking a ""FIRE number,"" which is the amount of money they need to save to generate enough income to cover expenses without having to work.Generally, this means saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt.Bottom line: ""Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,"" explains Danielle R.

SoftBank's CEO went big on China. Now he's pulling back,"The Japanese billionaire said at an earnings presentation Tuesday that he would take a cautious approach until the impact of new regulations are clear.Chinese companies accounted for 23% of SoftBank's massive Vision Fund investment portfolio at the end of July. But only 11% of Vision Fund investment has been directed to the country since April, Son said.""It's because we would like to wait and see a while,"" he added. Taking questions from reporters, Son acknowledged that the company was ""facing tough challenges when it comes to investments in China.""""That's true,"" he said. ""That's something we'd like to be careful about, and be cautious. Once we have a better view, then we'd like to resume [further] investments.""In recent months, China has embarked on a major clampdown on private enterprise, which has engulfed some of the country's top players. Initially, it appeared that regulators' main target was the booming tech sector, but lately that has expanded to reach other industries, such as private education.Investors have been rattled. So far, the events have wiped out more than $1.2 trillion in market value and stoked fears about the future of innovation in the world's second largest economy. Son said he was concerned about the the impact regulations would have on stock markets. SoftBank (SFTBF), one of the world's largest tech investors, holds stakes in several top Chinese firms, including e-commerce titan Alibaba (BABA), ride-hailing giant Didi and TikTok owner ByteDance. Didi has especially felt the pain lately, with an initial public offering in the United States that went downhill after Beijing launched a probe into the company and banned it from Chinese app stores.Son did not comment on Didi specifically during the presentation, but said that he still had ""good expectations"" from SoftBank's portfolio companies in China.He reiterated that the firm wanted to ""wait and see how things go"" as regulations continued to roll out, adding that there was no specific timeline on how long it planned to take that approach.""Is it six months, 12 months? I don't know yet,"" the executive said. ""[But] in one year or two years, under the new rules, and under new orders, I think things will be much clearer ... Once things get clearer, then we are open to resuming active investment.""Son's remarks came as SoftBank posted a nearly 40% drop in profits Tuesday. Net income fell to 761.5 billion yen ($6.9 billion) in the quarter ended June compared to the same period a year ago.The company largely attributed that to a major one-off gain it received last year based on the merger of Sprint (S) — which Son had bought in 2013 — and T-Mobile (TMUS).Despite the crackdown, Son said he remains bullish on China in the long run.""There are still risks out there, like the risks in China. But we want to take risks,"" he said. ""We are not against or for the Chinese government, and we don't have any doubt about [the] future potential of China.""— Laura He contributed to this report.",2021-08-10,investing,CNN
Warren Buffett is buying more of his own stock as Berkshire profits surge,"Berkshire (BRKB) reported strong second quarter earnings on Saturday. Overall profits came in at $28.1 billion in the second quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago, And Berkshire's net income for the first half of 2021 hit $39.8 billion, reversing a $23.5 billion loss in the first six months of 2020.Operating profits, a measure that Buffett and many analysts and investors prefer to look at as a true measure of Berkshire's health, rebounded sharply as well. The company posted an operating profit of $6.7 billion in the second quarter, a 21% surge from a year ago.Yet Buffett, who has a net worth of nearly $105 billion, continues to be cautious. Berkshire has a giant pile of cash that is growing even bigger as Berkshire looks for more investing opportunities. The company had $144.1 billion on its balance sheet as of the end of June, up from $138.3 billion in December.Although Buffett is famous for making savvy investments in blue chip American companies like Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP), Berkshire has recently been splurging on its own stock. The company disclosed Saturday that it repurchased $6 billion of its shares in the second quarter. It has now bought back $12.6 billion in Berkshire stock so far this year. That's been a good investment as of late. Shares of Berkshire's more affordable B shares, which trade for around $285 and are in the S&P 500, are up 23% this year — outperforming the broader market. The company's A shares (BRKA), which do not split, trade for about $430,000 apiece.  Still, Buffett has long talked about wanting to do one more ""elephant-sized"" acquisition to broaden out the company's portfolio of assets. But make no mistake: Berkshire is doing just fine with what it already owns.Berkshire's railroad, utilities and energy businesses were a big winner in the second quarter, posting a 28% jump in operating earnings. Berkshire owns the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy utility companies.The company's ""other"" business unit, which includes a variety of consumer companies ranging from Dairy Queen and See's Candies to Duracell batteries, Benjamin Moore paints and Fruit of the Loom underwear. In a sign of how important these businesses are to Berkshire, the company announced in May that Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman in charge of the company's non-insurance operations, will succeed the soon to be 91-year old Buffett as Berkshire CEO once he either retires or passes away. Ajit Jain, another Berkshire vice chairman, runs the company's massive insurance unit, which includes auto and home insurance giant Geico. ",2021-08-09,investing,CNN
You might be able to retire earlier than you think. Here's how,"Financial Independence Retire Early -- or FIRE -- is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence and security as early as possible.""The mentality behind the movement is where one strives to live life on their own terms and to get off the proverbial hamster wheel where you are dependent on your employer and have the freedom and security to do so,"" said Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.   That could mean having the financial freedom to change careers, work less or travel the world. So what exactly does the FIRE movement entail? Here's everything you need to know.What is FIRE?The concept of FIRE is based on the notion that retirement is determined by a financial number and not by a person's age. It focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. That means usually saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of your annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt. ""FIRE involves a shift in perspective regarding money and work, prioritizing what is most important to your work-life balance, and making decisions not dictated by the need to earn money but the ultimate goal of financial freedom,"" said AnnaMarie Mock, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser for Highland Financial Advisors. People looking to pursue FIRE typically start by picking what's called a FIRE number, which is the amount of money you'd need to have saved to generate enough income to cover your expenses without having to work.To determine your FIRE number, start off by figuring out your yearly expenses, excluding savings and taxes. From there, calculate how much savings you'll need to generate that much income without having a paycheck. One rule of thumb, known as the 4% rule, says that retirees can safely withdraw about 4% of their savings a year without running out of money. That means saving 25 times your current annual expenses could last indefinitely with regular 4% yearly withdrawals.For example, if your annual expenses are $50,000 per year, you would need at least $1,250,000 ($50,000 x 25) saved when you retire. You can also take a more conservative approach by saving 28 to 33 times your current expenses, and take only 3% to 3.5% withdrawals. From there, try an online calculator to determine how much to save and when you can reach that early nest egg number. Starting as early as possible comes with many advantages. After all, getting a head start on your savings and investments gives your money more time to compound. But even though retiring early requires various sacrifices when it comes to saving and spending, the perks can be rewarding. ""The biggest perk of FIRE is independence,"" said Kevin Chancellor, a certified Social Security claiming strategist and financial adviser. ""If your budget is still sustainable then you have the freedom to travel, be involved in your kid's school activities, start a side business or hobby, and spend more time doing what you want to do rather than what you need to do.""Reaching the magic numberMany people think they don't earn enough to be able to retire early. But there are several methods of reaching FIRE that could help them retire faster than they think. When making the decision to retire early, you should expect to make some significant lifestyle changes. Those changes could be as big as increasing your streams of income or as small as cutting your own hair. It all comes down to either reducing how much you spend or boosting how much you save -- or both. ""Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,"" said Harrison. One way to do that is to drastically slash expenses and live a more frugal and lean lifestyle, which is often the quickest way to FIRE. Known as ""Lean FIRE,"" this typically means having a lower target number for your nest egg and living more modestly in retirement. Those who aren't interested in pinching pennies and have higher-than-average expenses can still retire by increasing their income.Some ways to achieve ""Fat FIRE,"" as it's known, could involve negotiating a higher salary, finding a higher paying job, accumulating sought-after skills, working a side-hustle or owning rental properties. Often, those pursuing Fat FIRE will either choose to work in higher paying professions or take longer to reach their larger savings goal.Some people who want to retire sooner can pursue another method often called ""Barista FIRE."" In this scenario, you can quit your full-time day job once you've stashed away enough retirement savings to grow into a nice nest egg in a few more years without having to add funds. But rather than ceasing work altogether, you work a part-time job, pursue a less lucrative dream career or take on freelance projects in order to cover basic living expenses, all the while allowing your long-term retirement savings to grow until a more traditional retirement age. Is FIRE right for me?Another thing to consider is how you'll spend your time without filling your days with a paid job. For example, will you pursue hobbies, volunteer or travel more? Without a plan in place, you might find that FIRE isn't all you'd hoped it would be.""For anyone retiring, it is important to know what you are retiring to. This is even more important for those looking to retire early,"" said Harrison. ""Figure out what is going to give your life meaning and purpose, so your retirement years can bring you joy.""",2021-08-09,business,CNN
Inflation wiped out America's pay raises,"But those fatter paychecks aren't going as far, thanks to rising inflation. In fact, compensation is now lower than it was in December 2019, when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis by Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University. The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account. (Wages and salaries are growing at a faster pace than benefits.)""The hot economy is heating prices more than it is heating wages,"" said Furman.The index is not subject to the same distortions as other measures, such as average hourly earnings, because it keeps the composition of the workforce constant. The average hourly earnings metric has been swinging during the pandemic as many lower-wage workers lost their jobs initially and are now returning to work.Not counting inflation, compensation rose 2.8% between March and June, despite the relatively high unemployment rate -- a trend that reflects the tight labor market. Job openings are at record-high levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But at the same time, prices are soaring. Gas costs more. Food is more expensive. Car prices are at record levels.The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008, according to federal data.Americans are noticing, raising concerns about the higher prices for homes, cars and household goods, such as appliances, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers released in late July. Still, they generally view the price hikes as short-term, and their improved finances has greatly reduced their resistance to the increases, Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, wrote in the most recent report.Differences by industryInflation-adjusted compensation is down in most industries, but there is one notable exception: Leisure and hospitality. That industry's employers are scrambling to find workers, resulting in a 1.6% bump in pay and benefits since December 2019, according to Furman's analysis.But employees of the utilities industry saw their real compensation slide 1% since December 2019. In education and health services, their real compensation slid 0.8%. Manufacturing fell 0.7% and in transportation and warehousing, real compensation slipped 0.6%.Just how long the steep rise in inflation will last remains a subject of debate. President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve are arguing that it won't be a long-term issue, while some experts worry that the price increases may be more entrenched.But if the inflation growth rate starts to ease, workers will be better able to enjoy their boost in pay.""To the extent that inflation is transitory, this dip in real wages is also transitory,"" said Tim Duy, chief US economist at SGH Macro Advisors, a research firm for the financial industry and policymakers.",2021-08-10,business,CNN
Why big chains aren't requiring vaccines for customers ,"Representatives for retailers and restaurants and HR consultants who work with companies say it's too risky for frontline staff to be put in the position of enforcing vaccine rules for customers. Half of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and pockets of Americans remain resistant or fiercely opposed to getting the shots. There's also the risk that such requirements would alienate customers.Requiring customers to mask up throughout the pandemic has led to confrontations between customers who oppose mask wearing and store staff. Mandating vaccines would be even more challenging for businesses and jeopardize worker safety, industry trade groups say. Instead, large chains are taking different approaches. McDonald's (MCD) is requiring its workers to mask up in high-risk areas and that customers do so as well. Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others are requiring workers to wear masks but only recommending that customers do, too, in high-risk areas. Walmart, Walgreens (WBA) and Gap (GPS) are requiring corporate employees to be vaccinated as they seek to bring people back to the office, but not frontline staff in stores. Walmart, the largest private US employer, has said it hopes that requiring corporate staff to be vaccinated will convince more retail workers to get the shots.""We want to stick with the message that strongly encourages everybody to get vaccinated, but don't want to create a situation where employees basically have a risk of physical assault, because it happened last year,"" said Larry Lynch, senior vice president of science and industry for the National Restaurant Association. ""That's our biggest fear.""David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, doesn't believe vaccine mandates for customers are the ""right step"" for retail chains, and they would be unable to enforce such mandates.""Store employees are not trained to be security enforcement people,"" he said. ""What do you do if someone says they're coming in and not going to show their vaccination status?""No technology in placeThere are other barriers to vaccine requirements for customers aside from safety concerns, too. Most retail stores ""don't have any experience with requiring things like an ID to come into a store,"" French said, and it would hurt the quality of their customer service to be scrutinizing shoppers' vaccine status. There is no technology in place for retailers to easily check customers' vaccine status nationwide, he said. And then there's the question of what would happen if people forgot their vaccine cards at home or were accompanied by children who are not yet vaccinated.""There are some real practical problems with requiring vaccination status to enter a retail store,"" he said. ""It's something a lot of retailers are scratching their heads at.""Vaccine mandates for customers would also clash with some state and local rules, these industry groups say. Fourteen states have banned so-called vaccine passports — digital apps that allow users to show proof of vaccination before entering events and businesses — according to the National Academy for State Health Policy, a non-profit health policy organization which tracks such data.Companies' decisions on how to approach vaccine rules come as more businesses start to require vaccines for their workers and cities such as New York mandate them for customers to eat indoors and visit gyms. Some New York City restaurants are welcoming the new requirement. They hope that the measure will help avoid another shutdown, and are looking for support from the city to help them put it into place.But for the most part, it's easier for companies to set employment requirements for their own workforce than unfamiliar customers coming in every day, said Craig Rowley, senior client partner specializing in retail at executive search firm Korn Ferry.Public attitude on vaccine mandates for customers is sharply divided, another consideration for businesses.A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,290 adults from July 27 to August 2 found that 52% support requiring proof of vaccination for airline passengers, 49% support vaccine proof for attendees of large sports and entertainment events, and just 37% support proof for restaurant customers.""There are varying opinions on who should be required to prove they have had the vaccine. Yes on proof of vaccination for those who fly, a toss-up for people attending large events, and a no for people going to restaurants,"" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy.",2021-08-09,business,CNN
JetBlue to launch NY-UK flights despite pandemic,"JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday.Chief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was ""strong demand"" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels.The move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover.Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was ""returning strongly"".In its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year.""Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,"" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr.""It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China.""Measured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said.JetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September.However, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (Â£679) one-way.That is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period.Thanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York.And other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay.However, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian.And for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600.The airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now ""ready to go"".He said JetBlue wanted to have ""a disruptive and permanent effect"" on the market.US-based travellers are now welcome to fly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival if they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. The White House said at the end of last month that it did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.Asked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was ""not risk-based"".",2021-08-10,business,BBC
China sues Tencent over WeChat Youth Mode,"Beijing prosecutors have filed a civil legal action against Tencent over claims its messaging-app WeChat's Youth Mode does not comply with laws protecting minors. Youth Mode prevents younger users from accessing payments, playing certain games and finding nearby friends. However, prosecutors have not specified exactly how the app is allegedly violating Chinese law. Tencent said it would ""investigate"" the claim. ""We will earnestly inspect and check the functions of WeChat Youth Mode, accept user suggestions humbly and sincerely respond to civil public-interest litigation,"" the company posted on Weibo.WeChat, known as Weixin in China, has about 1.26 billion monthly active users.Last week, Chinese authorities called for minors to be better protected from online dangers, with a state-media article labelling games as ""spiritual opium"". Tencent's share price fell by more than 10% shortly after the article was published. And it swiftly announced stricter limits for younger players of its hugely popular game Honour of Kings. Young players can now access the game for only an hour a day on weekdays. Play time in China was previously capped at:The mobile title has more than 100 million users worldwide. In April, it was reported Chinese authorities were preparing a substantial fine for Tencent as part of its efforts to clamp down on internet giants. ",2021-08-09,tech,BBC
Sharing apps are booming but will the kindness continue?,"The pandemic, and lockdown, made Adam Ellison want to help other people.Before coronavirus, he was content with his job in marketing and his own social bubble. But that changed when millions faced hardship due to pandemic disruption caused by the virus. ""I've become more conscious of everybody else,"" he says. ""Some people have had it worse.""In October, he signed up to be a volunteer on Olio, an app that allows people to share edible food waste with others. Every Saturday, Mr Ellison, who lives in a small town near Kilmarnock in Scotland, goes to Tesco at 07:00 to collect unsold produce. Bread, avocados, limes, tomatoes, herbs - it changes every week. He adds whatever items he collects to the app and people who live nearby can request them for pickup. Often, all the food is gone within a day.The number of users on Olio has doubled during the pandemic, from 2 million to 4 million worldwide. It's one of several apps and social media sites that have seen a sharp increase in charitable activity since the emergence of Covid-19.""The demand is just off the chart,"" says Tessa Clarke, Olio's co-founder. The app used to see just under 300,000 food items listed every month. That figure is now roughly 1.6 million, and half of all items are requested by the app's users within 30 minutes of being listed.The boom is partly down to the partnership between Olio and Tesco, which was announced last September. It allows Olio volunteers like Mr Ellison to collect and share food waste not claimed by charities. But Ms Clarke says the pandemic has also motivated people to think differently about food waste - particularly after images of empty supermarket shelves circulated in March last year. ""That led to an almost overnight step-change in terms of people actually valuing food,"" she says. People who claim food on Olio may be facing hunger, or they may simply want to help reduce food waste. Ms Clarke notes that there was, sadly, a noticeable rise in users seeking food for their families via Olio because of a loss of income, or suspension of free school meals.Just a few weeks into redistributing food via the app, Mr Ellison received a message from someone who was particularly in need of food. ""I was in a position where I could actually really help this person,"" he says. ""I can't explain how good that feels, to be able to do that for someone else.""In August, Olio will branch out with a new feature called Borrow, where users will be able to lend people items under a certain value, such as tools. The idea is to reduce the unnecessary purchase of objects that are only used very occasionally. Other apps, such as Freecycle.org and Nextdoor, have also registered a surge in altruistic behaviour during the pandemic.""We went from maybe 60,000 posts a day to 120,000 posts a day overnightâ¦ it was amazing,"" says Deron Beal, founder of Freecycle.org, a website that allows people to offer unwanted possessions to others for free online.The site was flooded with so much activity that Mr Beal's team had to activate additional servers to cope with demand, he adds.Freecycle.org users posted information about the location of vaccination sites, as well as offering home-made cloth masks for free. There was also an increase in listings of food and clothing items.Meanwhile, at Nextdoor, a social network that connects people who live in the same district, there was a 380% increase in posts from UK users that mentioned helping or assisting each another. ""About 70% of our members are still talking about wanting to shop local and supporting local businesses,"" adds Jennie Sager, head of Europe and Australia at Nextdoor.She adds that activity was very high in London, and cites one example of a father and daughter who gave away almost 300 plants for free to their neighbours via Nextdoor.""He thought it would help people reduce their stress,"" says Ms Sager. And the UK Help Map, through which users can offer and find help of various kinds, has received a million unique views. 78,000 people in the country have pinned their locations to the map and offered assistance to their neighbours.While altruistic interventions and acts of kindness have boomed on social apps, cash donations to charities fell during the pandemic, notes Cat Mahoney, research manager at the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF). Online donations rose, however. While they have since fallen again, they remain above pre-pandemic levels.The big question now is whether the broader surge of app-mediated compassion will continue. The influx of posts using terms related to kindness or giving on Nextdoor has been sustained throughout the pandemic, even in countries that have experienced long stretches of very low cases, says Ms Sager. ""When we see neighbourhoods go in and out of lockdown globally, we don't see a massive dip,"" she adds.And at Freecycle.org, some listings - such as free food - have become less common lately, though items people acquired for lockdown hobbies that they no longer need are currently in abundance on the site, says Mr Beal.Dr Oksana Gerwe at Brunel University says that people's familiarity with digital platforms, and their trust in online reviews, may have helped pave the way for online altruism during the pandemic. But she is sceptical that this activity will last unless people form true habits of giving and helping each other regularly. One person who might fit the bill is Mr Ellison. He says his experience of volunteering via Olio has strengthened his belief in the power of communities.""If everybody did something small but meaningful, we'd live in a much, much better society,"" he says. ""I think Covid's been a catalyst for that.""",2021-08-09,business,BBC
TikTok named as the most downloaded app of 2020,"TikTok was the world's most downloaded app in 2020 as it took the top spot from Facebook Messenger, according to digital analytics company App Annie.The Chinese video-sharing platform is the only app not owned by Facebook to make the global top five of downloads.In its home country, TikTok's owner ByteDance also holds the top spot with the Chinese language video app Douyin.TikTok's continued popularity emerged even after former US President Donald Trump tried to ban it in America.Facebook-owned apps have held the top spot since the survey started in 2018 and the company still dominated the chart.Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant accounted for the rest of the top five with Facebook's flagship app as well as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger all making an appearance.Last year, then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order to ban new downloads of the TikTok app in the US.The Trump administration claimed that TikTok posed a national security risk as the Chinese government had access to its user data. The company repeatedly denied the allegations.A potential deal to resolve the issue that would have seen parent company ByteDance selling part of its US business to US technology giant Oracle and retailer Walmart was given the tentative green light from Mr Trump but was never approved by the Chinese government.Since becoming US President in January this year Joe Biden has withdrawn Mr Trump's executive order.As well as seeing off that challenge in the US the company has been exploring new ways to attract users.Last week, it emerged that TikTok is trialling a new vanishing clips feature similar to functions on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram.TikTok Stories will allow users to see content posted by accounts they follow for 24 hours before they are deleted.It came after WhatsApp rolled out a feature for users to post photos or videos that vanish after they are seen.",2021-08-10,business,BBC
US job vacancies hit a record 10.1 million,"US job openings hit a fresh record in June amid reports the country continues to face a labour shortage. Job vacancies jumped by 590,000 to 10.1 million on the last day of the month, according to figures from the Labor Department.That was up from a record 9.5 million openings in May and well above economists' expectations.It comes as companies struggle to find workers in sectors such as leisure and hospitality as the economy reopens.""The ratio of openings to hires, despite easing in June, remained at historically elevated levels,"" JPMorgan analyst Peter McCrory said.US unemployment surged to 14.8% at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but the economy has been recovering strongly this year. However, despite restrictions being eased, workers have not rushed back to jobs in the numbers expected. The shortfall has been blamed on a lack of affordable childcare, generous unemployment benefits, and pandemic-related retirements and career changes.Some also believe there are too many low-skilled jobs being advertised, and not enough suitable candidates.Official unemployment figures in July suggested the country might be turning a corner, as employment rose by 943,000. The unemployment rate also fell 0.5 percentage points to 5.4%.However the figures mainly pre-date the rise of the Delta variant of Covid in the US, which has led to a surge in infections and fears new restrictions could be imposed.Already New York City has said all customers and staff of restaurants, gyms and other indoor businesses will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.And the city's Auto Show, scheduled to run from 20 to 29 August, has been cancelled due to fears about rising infection rates.  Figures from the Labor Department showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in June increased to 3.9 million from 3.6 million in May, well above pre-pandemic levels.However, in a positive sign hiring rose to 6.7 million from 6 million in the previous month, the second largest increase since the government started tracking the data in 2000. The largest increases in vacancies in June were in professional and business services, retail, and accommodation and food services.Some economists believe hiring will pick up further as schools reopen in September and more states phase out emergency unemployment benefits.   Economists are also increasingly confident that US unemployment levels will reach pre-pandemic levels next year, with Goldman Sachs projecting a rate of 3.5% by the end of 2022.",2021-08-09,business,BBC
Apple defends new photo scanning child protection tech,"Apple has defended its new system that scans users' phones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), after a backlash from customers and privacy advocates. The technology searches for matches of known abuse material before the image is uploaded to its iCloud storage.Critics warned it could be a ""backdoor"" to spy on people, and more than 5,000 people and organisations have signed an open letter against the technology. As a result, Apple has pledged not to ""expand"" the system for any reason.Digital privacy campaigners warned last week that authoritarian governments could use the technology to bolster anti-LGBT regimes, or crack down on political dissidents in countries where protests are deemed illegal.But Apple said it would ""will not accede to any government's request to expand"" the system.It published a question-and-answer document, saying it had numerous safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used for anything other than the detection of child abuse imagery. ""We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,"" it said.However, Apple has made some concessions in the past in order to keep operating in countries around the world. Last New Year's Eve, the tech giant removed 39,000 apps from its Chinese App Store amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by authorities in the country. Apple also said its anti-CSAM tool will not allow the company to see or scan a user's photo album. It will only scan photos that are shared on iCloud.The system will look for matches, securely on the device, based on a database of hashes of known CSAM images provided by child safety organisations.Apple also claims it is nearly impossible to falsely flag innocent people to police. ""The likelihood that the system would incorrectly flag any given account is less than one in one trillion per year,"" it said. There is also a human review of positive matches.Privacy advocates, however, have argued that the only thing preventing that technology being turned to other uses is Apple's promise that it will not be.Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for example, said that ""all it would take... is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content"".""That's not a slippery slope; that's a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change,"" it warned.Apple also provided reassurances regarding another new feature that will warn children and their parents using linked family accounts, when sexually explicit photos are sent or received. The company says its two new features do not use the same technology, and says it will ""never"" gain access to users' private communications. While there was a backlash regarding Apple's announcement from privacy advocates, some politicians welcomed the new technology. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was time for others, especially Facebook, to follow suit.",2021-08-09,tech,BBC
Paddy Power owner revenue soars amid online gambling boom,"Paddy Power-owner Flutter has said its UK betting shop revenue has jumped higher than pre-Covid levels.Betting shops were closed during lockdowns but since reopening in June, Flutter said UK retail revenue rose 7% ahead of sales before the pandemic.Like its rivals, Flutter has seen strong growth in online gambling as shops closed and people were forced to work from home.But one gambling helpline said calls had risen by 9% in the year to March.And punters came back to betting shops after they re-opened as Covid restrictions eased in the second quarter, with UK retail revenue 7% higher than pre-Covid levels, it said.The number of people using Flutter's online gambling in the UK leapt even more, increasing nearly 60%.A UK gambling helpline said calls had increased by 9% in the year to the end of March.Flutter said global revenue rose 28% to Â£3bn as its average number of gamblers rose 40% to more than 7.5 million.Chief executive Peter Jackson said: ""The first half of 2021 exceeded our expectations as we made substantial progress against our operational and strategic objectives while maintaining excellent momentum in growing our player base.""Many countries around the world closed down betting shops during coronavirus lockdowns, and gamblers shifted their focus online.Flutter attracted new customers during lockdowns, and kept hold of many of them in the first half, said Alistair Johnson, analyst at Redburn.Studies have suggested that online gambling soared during coronavirus lockdowns, with vulnerable groups particularly at risk.In the UK, Flutter, which owns brands such as Betfair and Sky Betting and Gaming, said it had 59% more online customers than in the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis.Overall, its UK and Ireland average monthly numbers grew 44% to 3.3 million customers.

Marlboro owner wants to buy a company that makes asthma inhalers. Health charities say it must be stopped,"Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PMI) on Sunday increased its offer for pharmaceutical company Vectura to more than £1 billion ($1.4 billion) in an attempt to fend off a rival bid from US private equity group Carlyle. The revised offer comes just weeks after the tobacco giant said it will stop selling Marlboro cigarettes in Britain within a decade. In a statement, Philip Morris International (PM) said it had increased its bid for Vectura to £1.65 ($2.29) per share, valuing the asthma inhaler maker at £1.02 billion ($1.4 billion).The deal would boost the tobacco giant's ambition to generate more than half of its net revenue from smoke-free products such as e-cigarettes and respiratory drugs within four years, up from about a quarter today. PMI currently sells cigarettes in more than 175 markets.Vectura has manufactured 13 inhaled medicines for companies such as Novartis (NVS) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to treat lung conditions including asthma. It is currently working on an inhalation treatment for Covid-19 with Inspira Pharmaceuticals, another UK company.""PMI intends to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit that will form the backbone of PMI's inhaled therapeutics business,"" Philip Morris International said. Tobacco companies are under pressure to diversify amid dwindling smoker numbers, a push from governments to reduce the prevalence and dangers of smoking, and moves by investors to strip tobacco products from their portfolios.Philip Morris International has invested $8 billion and hired dozens of scientists and technicians to develop alternatives to cigarettes, including its flagship IQOS product, which heats rather than burns tobacco.The company also recently bought Fertin Pharma, which manufactures oral drugs to treat pain, allergies and various other ailments.Philip Morris International was separated from New York-listed Altria (MO) in 2008. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, which sells cigarette brands including Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Parliament and Merit in the United States.Deal backlashHealth charities are skeptical of Philip Morris International's plans and have urged the UK government to block the Vectura deal, warning it will allow the tobacco industry to influence public health policy in Britain.""It's ironic that a tobacco company wants to invest in the lung health industry when their products are the biggest preventable cause of cancer, including lung cancer,"" Cancer Research UK's chief executive Michelle Mitchell said in a statement last month. ""If PMI really wanted to help, they could stop aggressively promoting and selling their products altogether,"" she added.In a letter to the UK government, Cancer Research UK, the British Lung Foundation and Action on Smoking and Health said there is ""huge unease"" that a tobacco company could profit from treatments for conditions such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.""There is a real prospect that PMI will use this acquisition to legitimise tobacco industry participation in health debates within the UK. This must not be allowed to happen,"" the organizations said, calling on the government to intervene.Philip Morris' revised offer came just two days after Carlyle raised its own bid for Vectura to £1.55 ($2.15) per share. Vectura had on Friday recommended the Carlyle offer to shareholders, voicing concerns around being owned by Philip Morris and saying it may be ""better positioned under Carlyle ownership.""

Another big bank is mandating vaccines,"Starting September 13, employees working in the bank's New York headquarters as well as other offices in the New York metropolitan area, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia, will need to be vaccinated and are expected in the office at least twice a week. For employees working at other branches, Citi (CPRJ) is strongly encouraging, but not requiring, vaccination. Those employees are required to wear masks and participate in company-provided rapid testing regardless of vaccination status. The bank said it is monitoring data but will not be bringing more employees back to any other corporate offices yet. Unlike other Wall Street banks, Citi's executives have been accepting of hybrid work. In March, the company recognized that hybrid work had been beneficial for some employees and promised to embrace flexibility when returning to the office.Joining the trendThe decision to mandate vaccinations adds Citi to a growing list of companies mandating vaccines for employees, and in some cases, customers.Morgan Stanley (AANXX) in June banned all unvaccinated staff, clients and guests from its New York office. All employees who work in buildings with a ""large employee presence"" were required to confirm their vaccination status by July 1, according to a company memo to employees. Jefferies (JEF) made a similar move, allowing only vaccinated vaccinated employees into the office, according to a memo the company's CEO and president sent to employees. Workers not fully vaccinated by Labor Day ""should continue to work from home,"" the memo said.Other companies mandating vaccines for corporate employees include Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Blackrock (BAAPX), Walmart (WMT) and Disney (DIS).

"Amazon will pay up to $1,000 in damages for dangerous items sold on its site","The company announced Tuesday that it will deal with customer satisfaction itself and go after companies afterward if third parties are unresponsive or unwilling to compensate valid claims. Amazon said the changes begin September 1 for all products sold on its website.Here's how it works: Customers can contact Amazon's customer service and they will notify the seller of the problem. If the seller doesn't respond, Amazon said it will ""address the immediate customer concern, bear the cost ourselves, and separately pursue the seller."" If the seller rejects the claim, Amazon said it might step in to help address the problem pay up to $1,000 at no cost to the seller.""This streamlined process will save time, money, and effort for both customers and sellers,"" Amazon said about its new ""A-to-z Guarantee."" That represents a shift from the current process of having buyers contact sellers directly about problems.In recent years, numerous products sold on Amazon have caught consumers' ire. For example, hoverboards, carbon monoxide detectors and faulty dog collars sold on Amazon have caused problems. That has sparked a lawsuit, called ""Oberdorf v. Amazon,"" that questions if the company can be held liable for damages caused by goods sold by third parties.Amazon (AMZN) said it's not a seller, rather just a marketplace for other sellers. ""If you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from Amazon,"" according to its conditions of use.

Meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations to solve the climate crisis,"While the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concludes that humans are ""unequivocally"" the cause of the crisis, climate experts say the onus of solving it should not rest on individuals' shoulders.Though we all should do what we can to limit our own greenhouse gas emissions, no amount of individual action — changing lightbulbs, turning up the thermostat or reducing plastic consumption — will address the magnitude of the problem, according to scientists and advocates who spoke with CNN. We need bold, global policies, they said, and lawmakers need to hold industry accountable for its role in perpetuating the crisis.Joeri Rogelj, a lead author for the UN report's chapter on global carbon cycles, says the world requires rapid change on a big scale to avoid catastrophic impacts.  ""As an individual, there are things we can do in our own lives, but they won't be sufficient to rise up to the challenge of halting climate change,"" Rogelj told CNN. ""What is really important is structural change — and that can only be achieved through long-term thinking and long-term investments and regulations."" Climate change is no longer a far off threat with nebulous outcomes. It's fueling deadly wildfires that are scorching entire towns, severe flooding and unrelenting drought that pits communities against each other.  As climate anxiety runs high, Rogelj said there are meaningful ways individuals can put pressure on corporations and policymakers to make rapid, stringent cuts on planet-heating emissions.  ""If you have savings, you can reach out to your community and put them in more environmentally friendly goals,"" Rogelj said. ""You can also talk to your decision-makers and let them know that this is an issue that you care about by writing them letters."" Lisa DeVille, an Indigenous environmental activist from North Dakota, has long leveraged environmental policies to rally her community and participate in public comment hearings about polluting infrastructure. If the climate crisis feels overwhelming, engage in the political process, she said. ""It's good to hear international scientists echoing what most of us can see with our own eyes,"" DeVille said. ""Climate change is real and that it's hurting people in our planet right now today."" Ultimately, big businesses and the fossil fuel industry need to be held accountable, according to Rogelj. Corporate change took the form of ousted board members this summer when activist shareholders replaced three people on ExxonMobil's board.  For the first time in modern history, America's largest oil company faced a credible challenge from an activist hedge fund, Engine No. 1, which was displeased with Exxon's financial performance and what it saw as the company's foot-dragging on climate. The vote was a major milestone in the climate battle. The Engine No. 1 campaign was the first proxy campaign at a major US company in which the case for change was built around the shift away from fossil fuels.  The climate crisis poses an existential threat to Exxon, one climate activists argue the company hasn't taken seriously enough. The big oil company has deployed Big Tobacco-like propaganda for decades in an effort to downplay the gravity of the climate crisis, shifting the blame to its consumers and protecting its own interests, according to a Harvard University study published earlier this year that used machine learning and algorithms to uncover trends in more than 200 public and internal Exxon documents between 1972 and 2019.In response to the study, Exxon told CNN Business in May that ""ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.""The Harvard study, Exxon added at the time, is ""clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies.""Months before the IPCC report was released, the International Energy Agency warned the world it needs to immediately stop drilling for oil and gas to prevent a climate catastrophe. The IEA report nudged companies toward renewables and urged milestones that included immediately stopping new gas and oil projects, halting the sale of new fossil fuel boilers starting in 2025 and increasing electric vehicle sales to at least 60% by 2030. The IEA also pointed to the economic benefits of focusing on climate change, emphasizing that the annual energy investment would surge to $5 trillion by 2030 from $2.3 trillion in recent years, adding 0.4 percentage points to global GDP growth. As the focus turns to the world's main greenhouse gas emitters — industrial sectors like agriculture or oil and gas — climate activists are pushing against the idea of individual actions like recycling or eating less meat.""We need to stop blaming ourselves and start holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for decades of disinformation and political sabotage,"" Jamie Henn, director of Fossil Free Media, a nonprofit media organization dedicated to the climate crisis.The concept of an individual having a ""carbon footprint"" has been emphasized in marketing campaigns designed for BP, for example, to maintain BP's image on climate change in China. In a 2007-2008 document, advertising company Ogilvy summarized the campaign: ""BP aims to be seen as an environmentally responsible company and supports efforts to reduce China's climate change impact. Encouraging environmental education among Chinese people is also a priority for BP.""Ogilvy also noted that, at the time, there had ""been over 500,000 visits to the website with 400,000 people clicking to calculate their carbon footprint.""""One thing individuals can do is look at what industries are in your backyard that you can really fight against,"" Maria Lopez-Nuñez, deputy director of the Ironbound Community Corporation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that focuses on climate and environmental justice, told CNN.  Lopez-Nuñez's organization has engaged with policymakers on pollution issues stemming from a local trash incinerator. The Covanta Essex incinerator in Newark burns nearly 985,000 tons of trash each year, according to the company. Incinerators, which were created due to limited space in landfills, emit greenhouse gas and can aerosolize other hazardous pollutants such as mercury and lead. Lopez-Nuñez says if you want to take meaningful action on the climate crisis, do some homework on the groups active in your area.""Find frontline organizations that are in neighborhood, not just the big organizations,"" said Lopez-Nuñez. ""When you don't know what's going on, go find the people that know the issues of your neighborhood, of your cities, of your state.""  ",2021-08-10,business,CNN
Eviction moratoriums aren't enough to rescue millions of Americans behind on rent,"US health officials issued a new eviction moratorium on August 3, temporarily barring landlords from removing tenants in regions with substantial or high Covid-19 transmission rates, (which applies to most of the country). For a moment, Matthews, a 41-year-old mother of two, breathed a sigh of relief.The ban on evictions bought her and her fiancé, Karel Williams, more time — the moratorium expires on October 3 — but it didn't resolve the $5,300 in back rent she still owed her landlord, Tom Taft, Sr., owner of Taft Family Ventures, a real estate development firm based in Greenville, North Carolina.""It was kind of a breath of fresh air, but I'm not sure if it's going to save us,"" Matthews told CNN Business of the moratorium.Limits of the eviction moratoriumThe existing stay on evictions may prevent law enforcement from removing renters from homes, but it doesn't stop landlords from filing eviction requests, according to attorney Mark Fessler, head of the housing unit at South Carolina Legal Services, a non-profit law firm specializing in civil law cases for low-income communities.""That's how the courts have interpreted the moratorium and how the CDC has explained the past moratorium in briefing in federal court,"" Fessler told CNN Business on Monday.Even if renters can't be removed, eviction court filings can stain a person's financial history for years.""It can, certainly for low income individuals, [make] it harder to find other housing and either [make] that housing more expensive or [force] them into substandard housing,"" Fessler added.Matthews recently applied to receive rent relief funds through a county Emergency Rental Assistance program funded through the $46 billion Congress set aside between the December stimulus plan and the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan.As of Monday afternoon, however, her landlord had refused to fill out a document agreeing to receive funds from the program, insisting that she pay a total of $3,600 in back rent in exchange for his cooperation.""He's holding up the process for me to help get him his money,"" Matthews said of Taft on Monday.Taft had his property manager withdraw his local housing court request to evict Matthews' family on Friday when he says Matthews paid him $1,600 in back rent. He said Matthews had agreed to pay an additional $2,000 on Monday before he signs her rental assistance papers.In the past, Taft said it has taken six to eight weeks for him to receive federal rent aid funds for Matthews and he's concerned she won't have enough to pay future rent if she falls behind again. ""She's going to be in this same situation and I'm going to have a lot less patience later,"" he said. ""We work with tenants. If they honor what they say they're going to do, then we work with them.""On Tuesday, Taft agreed to fill out Matthews' paperwork even though he said Matthews didn't give him the additional $2,000 she agreed to pay in exchange for his cooperation.I'm OK with that,"" he said. ""We're going to proceed ... We'll get that done today."" Evictions hit communities of colorResearchers and South Carolina housing assistance officials say this type of rental dispute has become more commonplace in the pandemic era. Matthews and her fiancé are two of the millions of Americans who were laid off during the spring of 2020, when state and local governments across the US forced many non-essential businesses to shut down to stem the spread of Covid-19. The original eviction moratorium initiated in September of last year was extended multiple times before expiring on July 31.Today nearly 6.4 million US households now owe their landlords more than $21.3 billion in back rent, according to an estimate by the National Equity Atlas created by PolicyLink, a research institute based in Oakland, California.An estimated 19% of American households with children say they are behind on rent, and roughly 15 million Americans overall are in danger of being evicted, according to a recent study from the Aspen Institute, a policy studies nonprofit headquartered in Washington, DC.Americans of color, like Matthews and her family, will be disproportionately hurt by upcoming evictions, the institute's researchers found. About 22% of Black renters and 17% of both Latino and Asian renters say they are in debt to their landlords, compared with 15% overall, according to the report.South Carolina leads the nation, with 29% of adults saying they're behind on rent. The eviction moratoriums have left landlords and property managers with the responsibility of providing housing to millions of US renters without sufficient resources, according to Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, an industry group representing property owners.Taft said the moratoriums and the federal rental assistance program have left landlords like him in limbo.""I was OK with it as long as it works,"" he said of the moratorium. ""A lot of states are slow-walking these payments and less than 15-20% of the money appropriated has been spent. That's what's been going on in South Carolina. We don't have much confidence in how much money we'll get and whether we'll be made whole. ... It becomes a question of business and you can't do this forever.""Low pay, high rentThe catalyst for South Carolina's eviction crisis is a combination of too many low-wage service and hospitality jobs and relatively high rent rates, according to Brian Grady, chief research officer at the South Carolina State Housing Finance and Development Authority, known as SC Housing.Grady's agency administers home ownership and affordable rental housing programs for low- and moderate-income South Carolinians. It's also in charge of distributing a portion of the $46 billion Congress has set aside for rent aid assistance.Rent in South Carolina cities like Charleston, Columbia and Myrtle Beach may not be high when compared with markets like New York or San Francisco, but Grady says South Carolina is disproportionately populated with low-income residents.""A quarter of renter households are severely cost burdened, meaning they spend more than half their income on rent and utilities,"" Grady told CNN Business. ""There's a lot of low-wage service jobs in South Carolina and those are the kind of jobs that were most hard hit by the initial impact of the pandemic.""The information gapMatthews, who worked as a medical assistant at a doctor's office before being laid off, says not enough is being done to let people know about rental assistance programs. She only found out about the aid after searching for solutions online.""They're not promoting it enough,"" Matthews said. ""You see [news] stories about PPP more than you see emergency rental assistance. They talk about stimulus...but they don't advertise or promote the fact there's money out here to get help. These things should be plastered for people to know there's help out there for you. You just have to apply."" Matthews' fiancé, who also was laid off in March 2020, found work as a line cook at a local barbecue restaurant in May of this year. But her own job search hasn't been as fruitful, she says, despite applying for many positions. The couple used their previous rent assistance aid money and some of their stimulus check savings to pay $11,000 in back rent in March of this year, after they received their first of two eviction notices from Taft.She says she stopped receiving unemployment benefits the same month. South Carolina Gov. Harry McMaster officially ended the state's participation in federal pandemic-related unemployment benefits programs on June 30 to compel South Carolinians to return to work.""Our governor is cutting off unemployment, but he's not telling his people about the other programs that can help them with utilities, rent and things that can help them stay in their homes,"" Matthews said.SC Housing says it promotes the emergency rental assistance program through churches, food banks, community centers, local government offices, landlord and realtor associations and a network of community non-profits to educate people about available funds.""We have also advertised through direct mail, texts, TV and radio, in addition to distributing materials at special community events,"" SC Housing communications and outreach director Renaye Long said.Lawmakers in states like South Carolina need to pass suppression laws that would hide or erase eviction records for renters who were impacted by the pandemic, says Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project's executive director Zach Neumann, who co-authored the Aspen Institute study. ""That would mean they don't have to drag that anchor around for the next seven years,"" Neumann told CNN Business. "" More broadly I think you can talk about changing the way you do credit reporting in America.""",2021-08-10,economy,CNN

DForce hacker returns $25m in 'stolen' crypto-currencies,"A mystery hacker allegedly stole $25m (Â£20m) in crypto-currencies - and then returned the funds two days later.Records show that funds in a variety of crypto-currencies were withdrawn from the DForce platform based in China. A sum of $10m was taken in Ethereum, for example, while a further $10m was taken in digital coins tied to the US dollar and $4m in other coins.Roughly the same amount has now been returned - although in a different mix of crypto-currencies.DForce is an online service that allows users to make crypto-currency transactions with one another.""The hackers have attempted to contact us and we intend to enter into discussions with them,"" wrote DForce founder Mindao Yang in a blog shortly after the attack happened, on Sunday.""This attack not only harmed our users, our partners, and my co-founders, but also me personally.

The BBC has also contacted DForce for comment.In a technical blog about the alleged hack, blockchain security firm PeckShield explained how the attacker managed to withdraw crypto-currency by tricking the DForce system.In essence, the attacker was allegedly able to withdraw funds by convincing the system that money had been deposited, when it had in fact been siphoned away.",2020-04-21,tech,BBC
"Tesla sales cratered in China, but investors don't seem to mind","The China Passenger Car Association reported that Tesla's sales in China fell to 8,621 cars in July, down nearly 70% from June. But the export of cars built at Tesla's Shanghai plant jumped to 24,347 for July, compared with 5,017 in June. That means total sales of Chinese-built Teslas fell less than 1% overall. Critics say the steep decline of sales to Chinese consumers is yet another sign of the growing problems the company faces in the country. Tesla is contending with increased competition from Chinese EV makers as well as a run of bad publicity, including a recall of virtually all of the cars that have been built in Shanghai. The company also faced protests by Telsa owners at this year's Shanghai auto show over poor car quality and various safety concerns flagged by Chinese regulators.Teslas accounted for just 3.9% of July sales of battery electric vehicles in China, down from 12.6% in June, said analyst Gordon Johnson, who has been among the harshest critics of the company. He said that decline shows Tesla is facing fiercer competition from local EV startups.""Overall, it now seems clear that Tesla has overbuilt Chinese capacity when compared to domestic demand, which will result in further price cuts and margin pressure,"" Johnson said. ""Given China is supposed to be Tesla's 'growth market,' these numbers should concern any Tesla bull.""But Tesla (TSLA) investors seemed unfazed by the sales dip, as shares declined less than 1% Tuesday. That's in sharp contrast to the steeper drops in the stock price following similar weak reports from the CPCA in April and May.Last month investors saw that declining numbers in China didn't stop Tesla from reporting better than expected global sales for the full quarter, said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull.""I think investors are becoming less sensitive to the month-to-month China numbers,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it's not been the best indicator of Tesla's success, as we saw in the second quarter.""But Ives said that if Tesla's sales in China don't improve, the company could face serious problems going forward.""Right now we believe that China will be 40% of deliveries for Tesla by next year,"" he said. ""So selling only 8,000 in a month, even though it's a volatile number, it doesn't give the bulls the warm and fuzzies.""Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not breakdown sales by market and only reports sales quarterly, not monthly. So the numbers from the CPCA are not confirmed. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.-- Laura He contributed to this report.",2021-08-10,investing,CNN
This company uses technology and nature to cut your air conditioning bill,"SkyCool Systems is trying to break that vicious cycle, using technology that promises to offer buildings an alternative means to cool down by essentially mimicking how the planet cools itself.""Our planet naturally cools itself by sending heat out in the form of infrared light or radiation,"" said Eli Goldstein, SkyCool's cofounder and CEO, through a process known as radiative cooling.""We're using that effect to essentially radiate heat out and out during the day and at night, even under direct sunlight."" The five-year-old company said it does this through rooftop panels made using nanotechnology. These panels consist of an optical film that radiates infrared light and cools itself in the process. They resemble solar panels but actually do the opposite, reflecting 97% of the sunlight that hits them and cooling the surface below, according to the company.SkyCool's model involves embedding a network of pipes below those panels. These pipes are filled with water, which is kept cool by the panels and then flows into a refrigeration or air conditioning system. This process is designed to take pressure off the system's cooling mechanism. And because the panels cool naturally and don't need external power to function, it helps the entire system use less electricity. A Grocery Outlet store in Stockton, California, which has been using SkyCool's system since last year, says it saw a marked drop in its electrical bills.""After we had our SkyCool system installed, our electricity company increased their rates on us,"" Jesus Valenzuela, the store manager, told CNN Business. ""We actually didn't see our bill go up at all. In fact, we saw it go just a little bit down,"" he added. Valenzuela estimates that the panels have saved his store roughly $3,000 a month.Scientists have been researching the benefits of radiative cooling for years, including Goldstein's co-founder and UCLA professor Aaswath Raman, who is a pioneer in the field. Several solutions and models to harness the process have been proposed in recent months.But there are some challenges, including a constraint familiar to the solar industry: it doesn't work as well without sunlight.""Our technology works best in hot, dry climates where the sky is clear, so when you have clouds, that blocks that radiative cooling window,"" Goldstein said. ""In the same way that [carbon dioxide] blocks light and sort of has that heat trapping effect, water vapor also will block infrared light."" But perhaps the biggest obstacle to making the technology ubiquitous is its relatively high cost. Most radiative cooling solutions ""suffer from a high manufacturing cost and large-scale production limits,"" researchers at China's Fudan University wrote in a paper published in the journal Nature earlier this year. Goldstein declined to reveal exactly how much SkyCool's panels cost but acknowledged that they are currently ""more expensive"" than solar panels.""New technologies like radiative cooling are often more expensive,"" he said. ""People are very sensitive to first cost, and so that is another barrier to getting new things out there.""Much of that is because of low production volumes, he said. Scaling up production could help bring the cost down, Goldstein said, particularly for developing countries in Asia and Africa where SkyCool hopes to eventually expand. For now, the company is focused on commercial applications of the technology, though it hopes to start installing panels on the roofs of individual homes. It has installed panels at other locations around California, including a retail store and a data center. ""We're just excited to be able to use this new technology for good,"" Goldstein said.",2021-08-09,tech,CNN
Don't get too excited about infrastructure just yet,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber?

The Dow and S&P 500 reached record highs on Tuesday after the Senate vote.Here's the thing: Money could begin to flow to shovel-ready upgrades relatively quickly, but it will take years for bigger projects to get underway. The latter category includes projects like broadband, water systems and railways.That means the immediate economic benefits will be limited.""There are typically long delays between appropriations and actual outlays when it comes to infrastructure spending; even though the bill specifies appropriation limits for five years, actual outlays may extend well beyond five years,"" analysts at Barclays wrote recently.Barclays said it expects only ""modestly stronger"" activity in 2022 and 2023 as a result of new infrastructure spending, with the biggest boost to GDP coming in 2024 and 2025. The bank upgraded its 2022 growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%.The good news is America doesn't have a near-term growth problem, with the economy still benefitting from massive stimulus and the ongoing return-to-work from the pandemic. In fact, the US economy is at risk of overheating.Reaction: The US Chamber of Commerce said it has been advocating for investment infrastructure for more than a decade. ""Our elected leaders are on the precipice of a historic investment in our nation's crumbling infrastructure. Turning this long-overdue promise into a reality will grow our economy and strengthen our competitiveness for decades to come,"" the powerful business lobby said in a statement.So, what will the money be spent on?$110 billion for roads, bridges and major infrastructure projects$39 billion to modernize public transit$66 billion in passenger and freight rail$17 billion in port infrastructure$25 billion on airport upgrades$65 billion to rebuild the electric grid$55 billion to upgrade water infrastructure$21 billion on environmental remediationThe list goes on, and my colleagues at CNN Politics have a full breakdown. Progress on infrastructure is one of several developments in Washington that investors should be monitoring this summer and fall. Early Wednesday, Senate Democrats approved a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, setting the stage for the party to attempt to pass a sweeping economic package that would expand the social safety net.Oh, and this: Republicans in the Senate say they won't vote to raise the debt ceiling, a mechanism that is a major source of frustration for investors. If Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling, the federal government will likely run out of cash by October or November, risking a disastrous default.The debt ceiling is a legal limit on how much the US government can borrow, and (so far as we know) unique among developed economies. Remember: Congress has already authorized this spending!Inflation wiped out America's pay raisesCompanies big and small are raising wages to attract workers and hold onto employees as the economy revs back into gear.But those fatter paychecks aren't going as far, thanks to rising inflation, reports my CNN colleague Tami Luhby. In fact, compensation is now lower than it was in December 2019, when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis by Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University.The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account. Not counting inflation, compensation rose 2.8% between March and June, despite the relatively high unemployment rate — a trend that reflects the tight labor market. Job openings are at record-high levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But at the same time, prices are soaring. Gas costs more. Food is more expensive. Car prices are at record levels. The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008.How long will the trend continue?

Robinhood investors may have the last laugh after lackluster IPO,"It's way too soon to make that call. But notably, shares of Robinhood debuted at $38 — the same price as Facebook (FB) in its May 2012 IPO. Today Facebook is trading at nearly $361.Robinhood has certainly had a rollercoaster ride so far: The stock tumbled 8% on its first day and fell as low as $33.25 the second day. But it's since roared back up to more than 40% above the IPO price and is now trading around $54, even briefly hitting a high of $85 last week. It's why some observers are labeling Robinhood a so-called meme stock, even though many detractors on Reddit have bashed the trading platform for a variety of reasons including its temporary ban on customers buying GameStop (GME) stock earlier this year.""The platform that powered the meme stock movement has itself become a meme stock — sometimes to Robinood's benefit and sometimes to its detriment,"" said Jonathan Anastas, chairman of Alpha Esports Tech, a mobile gaming firm. So much for the Reddit army of ""apes"" bringing Robinhood to its knees? Perhaps. The company has been credited with — and also criticized for — helping turn investing into something like a game. But Anastas argues Robinhood is simply following the money.""They appeal to a trader demographic that is focused more on emotion and momentum,"" Anastas said. ""Robinhood is not valued on fundamentals."" Already on the hunt for acquisitionsStill, Robinhood is now a publicly traded company with a market valuation north of $45 billion and it's looking to grow its business quickly — just like Facebook did before it.The platform announced Tuesday that it is buying Say Technologies, an online shareholder communications platform geared towards individual investors, for $140 million in cash.""Like Robinhood, Say was built on the belief that everyone should have the same access to the financial markets as Wall Street insiders,"" Aparna Chennapragrada, Robinhood's chief product officer, wrote in a blog post.""We share a common goal of eliminating the barriers that keep people from participating in our financial system,"" she added.The fact that Robinhood is looking to make an acquisition so soon after its IPO is also similar to a big deal Facebook pulled off back in 2012, just before it went public: Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, a deal that some felt was too pricey at the time.Facebook, like Robinhood, also struggled out of the gate. In fact, it was an even bigger IPO flop as shares plunged about 50% below their IPO price in the first few months of trading before bottoming out.But CEO Mark Zuckerberg wound up having the last laugh. The Instagram acquisition helped Facebook become a bigger player in mobile and allowed it to attract even more of the young users advertisers covet. Nine years after its ""failed"" IPO, Facebook is now worth more than $1 trillion.Plenty of competition in fintech and from Wall StreetIt's hardly a given, however, that Robinhood is on track for a similar surge by 2030. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, like Zuckerberg, will need to stay on top of market trends to get even bigger.""Robinhood has had a lot of naysayers but they've amassed millions of account holders and the marching orders are clear,"" said Michael Kamerman, CEO of Skilling, an online brokerage firm. ""I think Vlad wants to attract even higher net worth clients."" Robinhood will also need to fend off a large swath of competition over the next decade.Rival online trading firms ae gunning for Robinhood, including Webull and eToro, which is in the process of merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) so it too can go public.Meanwhile financial giants Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are courting retail traders more aggressively too, thanks to their respective acquisitions of online brokers TD Ameritrade and E-Trade.

Deliveroo orders double as lockdown habits endure,"Deliveroo has said demand for its services has strengthened despite Covid restrictions easing.The food delivery firm saw orders double to 148.8 million in the first half of this year, while the value of its transactions also doubled.At the same time, it narrowed its pre-tax losses to Â£104.8m, as against Â£128.4m a year earlier.It was the first set of results from the company since it floated on the stock market in March.Deliveroo initially listed on the London stock exchange at 390p a share, but the price fell sharply on the opening day of trading, 31 March.On Monday, its shares rallied on the news that German rival Delivery Hero had bought a 5% stake in the company worth Â£284m.But in Wednesday trading, it was down 3.3% at 351p.Cooped-up consumers flocked to order from Deliveroo during the earlier stages of the pandemic, when restaurants were closed and people switched to home deliveries.The firm said it expected customer behaviour to moderate later in the year, but it remained ""excited about the opportunity ahead"".It added that its outlook for the remainder of the year continued to be ""optimistic but prudent, combining confidence in continued year-on-year growth in orders with an expectation that average order values revert towards pre-pandemic levels"".Deliveroo said its gross transaction value for the six months was Â£3.4bn, a 99% rise from the same period in 2020. It repeated an earlier forecast that gross transaction value for the whole of 2021 would be 50% to 60% up on last year.Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: ""We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. ""Demand has been high amongst consumers. We have widened our consumer base, seen people continuing to order frequently and we now work with more food merchants than any other platform in the UK. ""At the same time, more riders are choosing to continue to work with the company because they value the work we offer.""By Rob Young, business correspondentFood delivery companies have been some of the standout winners of the pandemic. With people cooped up at home and dining in restaurants banned, a takeaway was for many the highlight of the lockdown week. Some analysts have questioned how much of that surge in business will persist as restaurants reopen. Interestingly, Deliveroo says orders are ""proving resilient"" since the re-emergence of the hospitality industry. But it doesn't expect that to remain the case forever. There are warnings that consumer behaviour ""may moderate"" later in the year and that the value (but not necessarily the number) of orders will return ""towards"" pre-pandemic levels. The company has diversified, though - it now delivers groceries from the likes of Waitrose, Co-op and Aldi. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has described Deliveroo as a ""true British tech success story"". By many measures, it is. But it's not yet a financial success. Despite the huge increase in business over the past year, Deliveroo still didn't make a profit. Its losses were smaller than a year ago, but the company ended the first half Â£104.8m in the red. Investors - who were lukewarm on the company's shares when they started trading in March - may be wondering: if Deliveroo can't make a profit when eating in restaurants isn't allowed, when can it?Deliveroo said it now covered 72% of the UK population. This was ahead of its plans, which had envisaged 67% coverage by the end of this year.In all, it operates in 11 countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.However, it said it had now decided to pull out of Spain, because ""achieving a top-tier market position would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns"".The move comes after the Spanish government announced plans to give more employment rights to workers at food delivery firms and other online services.""Deliveroo appears to be dominating the takeaway scene in many towns and cities, where its distinctive mint green-jacketed riders operate, despite Uber Eats and Just Eat rivals breathing down their neck,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.""But investors appeared to have lost a little appetite for shares in early trading, with the company expecting customer behaviour to moderate later in the year.""She added: ""There is speculation growing that Deliveroo could potentially be a target for takeover, given the rush of acquisitions in the British market.""",2021-08-11,business,BBC
Google may cut pay of staff who work from home,"Google employees in the US who opt to work from home permanently may get a pay cut.The technology giant has developed a pay calculator that lets employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices.Some remote employees, especially those with a long commute, could have their pay cut without changing address.Google has no plans at this time to implement the policy in the UK.Employees in many businesses have proved that working from home permanently is viable during Covid pandemic.Many companies are looking ahead to how employees will work as the pandemic recedes, even as the US continues to battle the Delta variant of the disease.Silicon Valley firms, some of which are keen to get employees back to their desks, are experimenting with employee pay structures.Big tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter have offered less pay for employees based in locations where it is more inexpensive to live.But smaller firms such as Reddit and Zillow have said they will pay the same no matter where employees are based, saying that this improves diversity.A Google spokesperson said: ""Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from.""Our new Work Location Tool was developed to help employees make informed decisions about which city or state they work from and any impact on compensation if they choose to relocate or work remotely."" One Google employee, who works in Seattle but has a two-hour commute, told Reuters that they would get a 10% pay cut if they decided to work from home full time. ""It's as high of a pay cut as I got for my most recent promotion,"" the employee said. ""I didn't do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut.""Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Google's move raises alarms about who will feel the impact most acutely, including families.""What's clear is that Google doesn't have to do this,"" Professor Rosenfeld said. ""Google has paid these workers at 100% of their prior wage, by definition. So it's not like they can't afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.""A Google employee in Stamford, Connecticut, which is an hour away from New York by train, would be paid 15% less working remotely, and there were 5% and 10% differences in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.Google will not change an employees pay if they work fully remotely from the same city.Some businesses, such as US technology giant Cisco, have put in place a hybrid working plan that has no mandates about how often employees go into the office.Cisco expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week.But other firms, such as Goldman Sachs, want workers to return to offices.The investment bank's boss David Solomon in February said that working from home was ""an aberration"" rather than ""the new normal"".",2021-08-11,business,BBC
Amazon to pay out over defective third party goods,"Amazon has said it will compensate customers who suffer injury or property damage from defective goods sold by independent sellers on its US platform. From 1 September it will pay valid claims of up to $1,000 (Â£720), which make up more than 80% of injury and damage cases on its site, it said. It may also cover claims for higher amounts if sellers are ""unresponsive"".It comes as the shopping giant faces mounting pressure over product safety, following a series of court cases.In July, Amazon was sued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission in an effort to force it to recall hundreds of thousands of goods.These included faulty carbon monoxide detectors, appliances without sufficient protection against electric shocks, and children's clothing that did not meet fire standards. More than half of the goods sold on Amazon now come via third-party vendors, but they are largely unvetted before being sold. For years, consumers have tried to hold the shopping giant to account over faulty products sold by third parties, but the firm has maintained sellers themselves are responsible - a position which has been backed by most courts. However, that has started to change in recent years following a series of high-profile court cases. In 2019, a Federal court in Philadelphia ruled that a woman blinded by a seller's retractable dog lead could restart her legal case against Amazon.She had initially wanted to sue the Nevada-based merchant but had been unable to track them down.In a blog posting, Amazon said it would use its ""advanced fraud and abuse detection systems"", as well as independent insurance fraud experts, to identify valid claims. It said this would save sellers time, money, and better protect customers. ""By standing behind customers and the products in our store, regardless of who sells them, Amazon is going far beyond our legal obligations and what any other marketplace service provider is doing today to protect customers,"" the company said.The firm also announced Amazon Insurance Accelerator, a network of insurance providers that sellers can access if they choose, and an updated policy requiring more merchants to obtain product liability insurance. The policies will launched in the US first before being rolled out elsewhere. ",2021-08-10,business,BBC
Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office?,"People in England are no longer being asked to work from home. Instead the Prime Minister Boris Johnson is recommending a ""gradual return to work"".However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. Employers in England were able to start planning for staff who have been able to work from home during the pandemic to return to the workplace after Covid restrictions were lifted on 19 July.The government wants to help companies which have struggled during lockdown, such as those in city centres which rely on office staff. It's also keen to cut the cost of paying furloughed staff by encouraging businesses to reopen.Most of the Covid restrictions in Scotland were lifted on 9 August as the country moved beyond the level zero rules which had been in place since 19 July.Physical distancing rules and the limits on gatherings have been removed, and all venues are allowed to reopen.However, the Scottish government is continuing to advise people to work from home where possible as part of a ""gradual approach"" to returning to offices. Most Covid restrictions in Wales were lifted on 7 August. Limits on meeting others have been removed, and all businesses can reopen. However, individual businesses - including offices and places open to the public such as pubs and restaurants - must carry out Covid risk assessments, and minimise the risk of coronavirus exposure to staff or customers, or face enforcement action.The Welsh government is also still advising that people should continue to work from home wherever possible. The Northern Ireland executive is expected to consider whether to update its guidance around working from home at its next meeting on 12 August. You can ask, but your employer doesn't have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future.""People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers.""The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions ""shouldn't signal a mass return to workplaces,"" and ""it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements"".Despite the removal of Covid restrictions in England, businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The government's Working Safely guidance still recommends that employers carry out health-and-safety risk assessments, and take reasonable steps to minimise the risks identified. Some businesses may choose to keep some of the measures they previously had in place, such as:The legal requirement to wear a face covering in England has ended. But government guidance says it ""expects and recommends"" the continued wearing of masks in crowded areas such as public transport.Masks remain compulsory on public transport and in certain other circumstances in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Regular lateral flow testing for Covid is already widespread in many sectors, and anyone in England or Scotland can also order tests directly.There's more detailed guidance for specific industries including construction, hospitality and manufacturing. Similar advice is available for employers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.If employees feel unsafe, they can contact their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE has carried more than 200,000 inspections to check companies are following Covid rules, and can force firms to take action if not. The CIPD says that employers should continue to ensure they have the necessary measures in place to give confidence to workers that their workplace is safe. ""This can include changes to desk spaces, shift patterns to help workers avoid busy times on public transport and use of one-way systems to reduce staff contact while the risk of infection remains,"" it says.Much of the risk depends on how crowded it is, and your distance from other people.Wearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible.Previous advice that millions of ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" people should shield, has now ended.Many continue to work from home, but if your job cannot be done remotely, your employer can ask you to return to the workplace. However, they still have a responsibility to keep you safe, so you should raise any specific concerns you have about going back. In addition, if you are disabled, your employer has an extra responsibility to make and pay for ""reasonable adjustments"".",2021-08-10,business,BBC
Working from home job adverts rise,"There has been a rise in jobs that advertise working from home compared with before the Covid pandemic, recruitment firm Reed has told the BBC. Prior to the pandemic, 1% of recruitment firm Reed's job vacancies advertised remote working, but this rose to 5% in 2021.Many office workers shifted to flexible working during coronavirus lockdowns.Reed said applications for jobs with remote working shot up, and outpaced the number of vacancies.But the number of flexible working adverts peaked at the beginning of the year, Reed said.Jobs advertising ""dynamic"" or ""hybrid"" working - that is, where people work from home some of the time - also increased at the start of the pandemic, as did applications for them.Since then, the percentage of jobs advertising hybrid working has dropped from 9.2% in January to 5.6% in July.Reed said that this could indicate that employers have not fully embraced flexible working as a permanent feature.But it could be that dynamic working has now become more widely accepted, and companies may not advertise it, just telling people about it at interview. The recruiter also said there have been lots of adverts for roles where people need to be working ""in person""  in recent months as lockdown restrictions ease in industries such as retail, transport and logistics, as well as health and medicine sectors.Chris Adcock, managing director of Reed Technology, said: ""During the pandemic we were forced into home working, and everyone got a bit of a taste for it, and really understood the benefit it could have in their lives.""We've seen people are twice as likely to apply for a job if it's advertised as remote,"" he said.The push for home working is largely coming from younger workers, he added, although ""water cooler moments"" at the office benefit people's careers.His remarks echo those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week told LinkedIn News he doubted he would have done as well if he had started his working life virtually.The pros and cons of working from home and returning to the office has been a hot topic as the UK emerges from the pandemic. Early in June, Apple staff launched a campaign to push back against CEO Tim Cook's plans to bring all employees back into the office by early September.Reed competitor CV-Library, an independent jobs board, also told the BBC the number of roles offering remote working rose between March and July in 2021, compared to 2020.""Working from home is here to stay and jobseekers are starting to expect flexible working as the norm,"" said its managing director Matthew Moore.""If companies want to attract and retain top talent, they need to get on board or will risk losing out on the best candidates on the market.""Jenny Elliott is a copywriter at children's toy company, Capikooa. She says she was attracted to the job after graduating last July because it offered flexible working options.The firm is based in the south of England, while Jenny is based in the north. ""What was key was the remote learning and working - so it was open to people who don't live near them, which was ideal. I could get trained, and work, entirely from home despite the business being physically in Cambridge,"" she says.""With remote working, I can control the distractions around me and create the ideal environment, which you can't really do in an office. I like working in a quiet space by myself, it takes a lot of pressure off really.""Jenny says she'd like to continue working in this way.""I'm quite used to it - and although I've never worked in an office, I've really enjoyed my remote working experience.""Technology giant Cisco is rolling out a hybrid working plan that has no mandates for how often employees go into the office.The firm now expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week.Francine Katsoudas, the chief people, policy and purpose officer at Cisco, said: ""It's going to be a big change for us.""""Despite the fact that we are a global company, that we have collaboration technology, and that we have a culture of flexibility, this is a big shift, because now all of our employees will be working hybrid, and it's not the exception any more,"" she said.""We have to change the way we meet, and the way that we work.""Teams and managers will make decisions about whether or not they need be in the office as a team on the same day, she added.",2021-08-11,business,BBC
Hackers steal $600m in major cryptocurrency heist,"Hackers have stolen some $600m (Â£433m) in what appears to be one the largest cryptocurrency heists ever. Blockchain site Poly Network said hackers had exploited a vulnerability in its system and taken thousands of digital tokens such as Ether. In a letter posted on Twitter, it urged the thieves to ""establish communication and return the hacked assets"". In scale, the hack is on par with huge recent breaches at exchanges such as Coincheck and Mt Gox.In its letter Poly Network said: ""The amount of money you have hacked is one of the biggest in defi [decentralised finance] history.""Law enforcement in any country will regard this as a major economic crime and you will be pursued. ""The money you stole are [sic] from tens of thousands of crypto community members, hence the people."" Poly Network said a preliminary investigation found a hacker exploited a ""vulnerability between contract calls"". It urged various exchanges to block deposits of the coins, after millions of dollars in tokens were transferred to separate cryptocurrency wallets.About $267m of Ether currency has been taken, $252m of Binance coins and roughly $85 million in USDC tokens. Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, said his firm was aware of the hack, but added there was only so much he could do. He said the group was ""co-ordinating with all our security partners to proactively help"".""There are no guarantees,"" he added.Poly Network is a decentralised finance - or Defi - provider, which allows users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network.Cryptocurrency systems such as Ether and Binance were developed independently, so have struggled to work in conjunction with each other. Losses from fraud in the Defi sector hit an all-time high of $474m in the first seven months of the year, a report from research company CipherTrace said on Tuesday.But losses from crime in the overall cryptocurrency market dropped sharply to $681m, compared to $1.9bn for the whole of 2020 and $4.5bn in 2019.Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Defi lender Blockchain Credit Partners and two of its top executives for raising $30m through allegedly fraudulent offerings.

China tech giant Xiaomi aims at global smartphone top spot,"Chinese technology giant Xiaomi has said it plans to be the world's biggest smartphone maker within three years.The comments by the Beijing-based firm's boss come after it recently overtook Apple to become the second largest mobile brand.South Korea's Samsung Electronics currently holds the number one spot.Xiaomi's founder and chief executive Lei Jun was speaking ahead of the launch of the company's new Mix 4 handset.""Our current task is to cement the number two position in the global market,"" Mr Lei said, adding: ""We aim to become global number one in three years.""He was making his annual speech during an online event as the company celebrated the 10th anniversary of its first smartphone launch.Industry figures released last month showed that Xiaomi had for the first time overtaken US rival Apple as the world's second-biggest smartphone brand.Xiaomi accounted for almost 17% of the global handset market in the April to June quarter, topping Apple's 14.1%, according to research firm IDC.For the same period Samsung saw its market share shrink to 18.8% but held on to the number one position.Like several other major Chinese technology firms, Xiaomi was accused by Donald Trump's administration of being a threat to US national security.At the start of the year it was blacklisted by the US Department of Defense over claims that it had ties with the China's military.In May, a US federal judge blocked the enforcement of an investment ban on Xiaomi, calling the decision to blacklist it as ""deeply flawed"".Had the ban gone ahead Xiaomi would have been removed from US stock exchanges and global benchmark shares indexes.Mr Lei's speech came ahead of the launch of a wide range of new Xiaomi devices, including the Mix 4 smartphone, its latest television, tablet computer and smart speaker.It also unveiled a 'CyberDog' four-legged robot, which it described as its ""first foray into quadruped robotics for the open source community and developers worldwide.""The company invited robotics enthusiasts and ""other like-minded Xiaomi Fans"" to help develop the project.Earlier this year, Xiaomi announced plans to invest $10bn (Â£7.2bn) over the next decade to develop electric vehicles.The move sees it enter another fiercely competitive sector, with hundreds of companies in China already battling for a share of the global electric vehicle market.",2021-08-11,business,BBC
$600 million gone: The biggest crypto theft in history ,"A vulnerability in Poly Network allowed the thief to make off with the funds, the platform said Tuesday, begging the attacker to return the money.

""The money you stole are from tens of thousands of crypto community members... you should talk to us to work out a solution.""Poly Network urged other members of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to ""blacklist"" the assets coming from addresses used by the attacker to siphon away the funds — which included a mix of various coins including $33 million of Tether, according to Tether's CTO. The cryptocurrency exchange Binance said it was ""coordinating with all our security partners to actively help."" Poly Network links together the blockchains of multiple virtual currencies to create interoperability among them. Following the hack, Poly Network established several addresses to which it said the attacker could return the money. And it appears the hacker is cooperating: As of 7:47 a.m. ET Wednesday, Poly Network said, it had received about $4.7 million back. It was not immediately clear who was behind the hack or why the money is being returned. Regulators have increased their scrutiny of crypto platforms as investors pour billions of dollars into digital currencies.
