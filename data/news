Alibaba fires employee accused of sexual assault as pressure mounts on Chinese tech,"The company on Monday said it has fired an employee after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who also works at Alibaba (BABA). The man confessed to actions that Alibaba deemed ""in serious violation of company policy,"" according to a memo sent by Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang to employees.Two senior employees also resigned after they ""failed to prioritize employee protection,"" according to Zhang's memo.""Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba's top priority,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business.The allegations — which were widely circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend — have rocked Alibaba at a time when it and other Chinese tech companies are already facing incredible scrutiny from Chinese regulators over their business. The claims triggered public outcry as many criticized the company for its handling of the situation. The controversy started after a post — allegedly written by the victim, who did not identify herself, and published on an internal Alibaba website — circulated on the Chinese social media website Weibo. According to screenshots of the 8,000-word account, the woman claimed she was assaulted by her supervisor during a business trip to Jinan, a city in eastern China, while she says she was drunk. ""The male leader even entered my hotel room four times that night with condom and assaulted me!!!! When I typed the lines above, I couldn't control myself, and I broke into tears. I never thought that I would have such an experience,"" she wrote. ""When I think about it now, it just feels like a nightmare, one that makes you terrified, scared, helpless, helpless nightmare!""CNN Business cannot confirm the authenticity of the post.The post has exploded on Chinese social media. Topics related to the incident have been viewed 850 million times on Weibo, generating more than 510,000 discussion posts. Some commenters accused Alibaba of failing to protect the rights of its employees. The woman allegedly claimed that the company brushed off her concerns when she reported them.""How come there are still female employees who have been pushed and pressured by their leaders to drink and are violated. Is this the Alibaba culture?"" wrote one Weibo user. ""I really hope the results of the investigation can become clear as soon as possible. Such a large company must protect its employees.""On Sunday, police in Jinan announced on Weibo that they had launched a probe into the case.""The police are actively investigating the matter and collecting evidence,"" they said in a statement. The accused has not been charged with any crime. In the memo to employees on Monday, Zhang said the employee confessed to ""intimate acts"" with a woman who was inebriated, violating company policy. ""Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement,"" Zhang added in the memo, which was posted publicly on the company's news website. ""He will be fired and never be rehired,"" Zhang wrote. Two executives, including the president of Alibaba's Neighborhood Retail group, have resigned over the handling of the incident, according to Zhang, who added that the woman reported the incident to the company August 2. ""We believe that the head of the business is both the owner of the business and the team's culture,"" Zhang wrote, adding that when the woman reported ""a horrendous act ... they did not make timely decisions nor took appropriate action.""""This incident has caused tremendous harm to her. We will do everything we can to take care of her,"" Zhang wrote.Zhang added that the company's chief people officer has also been reprimanded, and said that the company will establish a dedicated reporting channel for employees, as well as create an ""anti-sexual harassment policy"" that will include input from experts and employees. Zhang also acknowledged that the incident highlights what he called a culture of ""forced drinking,"" referring to alcohol-heavy events that are popular in China to secure business deals or build partnerships.  ""Although the police are still investigating the specific circumstances of the dinner that day, we are staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture,"" he wrote. ""Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or a supervisor, our employees are empowered to reject it.""The scandal's rapid spread on social media — along with the public outrage that ensued — comes as major firms, including Alibaba, have faced huge regulatory pressure. As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party's dominant role in every aspect of China's economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions.Complaints about work culture play into that scrutiny. Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm and rival to Alibaba, faced intense public backlash earlier this year  over accusations that it overworks its employees after two of its employees died unexpectedly, including a man who died by suicide. Chinese social media users started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture, and a former software engineer at the company escalated criticisms in several posts where he accused the company of overworking its employees. The company did not respond at the time to questions about the allegations made against its work culture, but did say that it had set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of a worker.",2021-08-09,tech,CNN
Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene's account for one week,"Greene tweeted on Monday that the Food and Drug Administration ""should not approve the covid vaccines."" She also claimed the vaccines were ""failing"" and that they were ineffective at reducing the virus's spread. In response, Twitter labeled the tweet as misleading and prevented Greene from tweeting for one week. The tweet, a company spokesperson said, ""was labeled in line with our COVID-19 misleading information policy. The account will be in read-only mode for a week due to repeated violations of the Twitter Rules.""Tuesday's suspension marks at least the third and toughest penalty Twitter has imposed on Greene for sharing misinformation. In January, Greene was suspended for 12 hours from Twitter for sharing conspiracy theories about the Georgia Senate runoff elections, a move that the company said violated its civic integrity policy. In July, Twitter suspended Greene again for 12 hours for sharing misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. (Greene was also temporarily suspended in March but was soon reinstated after Twitter said its automated systems had acted in error.)According to Twitter's Covid-19 misinformation policy, users can receive a one-week suspension if they violate that policy four times. Violating the Covid-19 policy five or more times can result in a permanent ban. Twitter declined to say how many times Greene has violated the company's rules.",2021-08-10,tech,CNN
Why Silicon Valley is betting on making this dystopian sci-fi idea a reality,"The metaverse was originally conceived as the setting for dystopian science fiction novels, where virtual universes provide an escape from crumbling societies. Now, the idea has transformed into a moonshot goal for Silicon Valley, and become a favorite talking point among startups, venture capitalists and tech giants.The idea is to create a space similar to the internet, but one that users (via digital avatars) can walk around inside of and where they can interact with one another in real time. In theory, you could, for example, sit around a virtual meeting table with colleagues from around the world — instead of staring at their 2D faces on Zoom — and then walk over to a virtual Starbucks to meet up with your mom, who lives across the country.  Zuckerberg has in recent weeks been extolling his vision for turning Facebook (FB) into a ""metaverse company,"" claiming that he began thinking about the concept in middle school. The company recently announced the creation of a new metaverse product group and Zuckerberg said he sees the technology as ""the successor to the mobile internet.""Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said last week that his company is working on building the ""enterprise metaverse."" Epic Games announced a $1 billion funding round in April to support its metaverse ambitions, pushing the Fortnite maker's valuation to nearly $30 billion. And in June, venture capitalist Matthew Ball helped launch an exchange traded fund so people can invest in the metaverse space, including companies like graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and gaming platform Roblox (RBLX). Despite the current hype cycle, the idea is still amorphous, and a fully functioning metaverse is probably years and billions of dollars away — if it happens at all. Big companies joining the discussion now may simply want to reassure investors that they won't miss out on what could be the next big thing, or that their investments in VR, which has yet to gain broad commercial appeal, will eventually pay off. And, especially in Facebook's case, playing up the long-term potential for the metaverse could be a useful way of distracting from growing scrutiny in the here and now.Whatever the motivations, big questions remain, from how tech companies may handle safety and privacy issues in the metaverse to whether people really want to live much of their lives inside an immersive virtual simulation.""My biggest concern about the metaverse is: Are we ready?"" said Avi Bar-Zeev, founder of AR and VR consultancy RealityPrime and a former employee at Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, where he worked on the HoloLens. ""Are we emotionally evolved enough yet to move beyond the safe division of having screens between us and typing words?"" he said. ""Are we safe to start interacting at a more person-to-person level, or are the a**holes still going to ruin it for everybody?"" What is the ""metaverse""?The ""metaverse"" was coined in the 1992 cyberpunk novel ""Snow Crash."" In the book, main character Hiro Protagonist — a hacker and, for a short time, pizza deliverer — uses the metaverse as an escape from his life, in which he lives with a roommate in a 20-by-30-foot storage container in a bleak world where the government has been replaced by corrupt corporations. In that story, the metaverse is a platform for virtual creation, but it's also rife with problems, including technology addiction, discrimination, harassment and violence, which occasionally spill over into the real world.That's a far cry from the optimistic potential that Zuckerberg and others have presented. But one sign that the metaverse is still far off: No one can quite agree on a clear definition of what it is, or could be.Experts working in the space tend to agree on a few key aspects of the metaverse, including the idea that users will experience a sense of ""embodiment"" or ""presence."" That is, they'll feel like they're actually inside a virtual space with other people, seeing things in first-person and probably 3D. It will also be able to host many users who can interact with one another in real time.  ""You can kind of think about [the metaverse] as an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.Much like the internet today, the metaverse won't be a single technology that gets switched on at once, but rather an ecosystem built over time by many different companies using a variety of technologies. Ideally, those various parts of the ecosystem will be interconnected and interoperable, said Jesse Alton, a leader at Open Metaverse, a group developing open source standards for the metaverse.""Someone who's playing a video game could win a flaming sword in their favorite game on Xbox, put it in their inventory, and later in VR, they can show it to their friend and their friend can hold it,"" said Alton, who is also the founder of extended reality firm AngellXR. ""It's the ability to transport [information] from one world to another, regardless of which platform it's in."" Some pieces of the metaverse already exist. Services like Fortnite, an online game in which users can compete, socialize and build virtual worlds with millions of other players, can give users an early sense of how it will work. And some people have already spent thousands of dollars on virtual homes, staking out their piece of metaverse real estate. Why is everyone suddenly talking about it? The metaverse is a relatively old idea that seems to gain momentum every few years, only to fade from the conversation in lieu of more immediate opportunities. Perhaps predictably, those working on this technology see signs that this time could be different.""A lot of the folks that were working on it before ... are still involved, it's just that we've been waiting for certain technological advancements,"" Alton said. Improvements in mobile device processors, gaming systems, internet infrastructure, virtual reality headsets and cryptocurrency are all crucial building blocks for creating the metaverse and ensuring consumer adoption. What's more, after the pandemic forced much of the world to work, learn and socialize from home, many people may feel more comfortable interacting virtually than they did two years ago, something tech companies may be trying to capitalize on. ""[A change like] this is always a multi-decade, iterative process ... and yet, despite that fact, there is an unmistakable sense over the past few years that the foundational pieces are coming together in a way that feels very new and very different,"" Ball, the venture capitalist, said. Will the metaverse have the same problems as the internet? Proponents of the metaverse say there could eventually be huge business potential — a whole new platform on which to sell digital goods and services. It could also have benefits for how humans interact using technology.""What we're really doing is figuring out ways to add technology into our lives to make our lives better and to enhance our communication with other people,"" RealityPrime's Bar-Zeev said. ""It's not just about conquering a whole new world."" But there are also a host of concerns about how the metaverse could be used or exploited. Zuckerberg said last week that advertisements will likely be a key source of revenue in the metaverse, just as they are for the company today. But some in the space worry that an ad-based business model will create haves, who can afford to pay for an ad-free headset or metaverse experience, and have-nots who can't, replicating inequalities present in the real world.""I don't want to see a world in which we segregate people into those who can afford it get a better experience and those who can't afford it have this crappy experience of being exploited for advertising,"" Bar-Zeev said. He added that online harassment could become more intense when users can assault each others' virtual bodies, rather than just trading ugly words on a screen. Data privacy and security could also become greater concerns when ""more of our lives, our data, our labor, our investments now exist in purely virtual form,"" Ball said. And other issues, such as misinformation and radicalization, could worsen in the metaverse, too.""If you can now replace somebody's entire reality with an alternate reality, you can make them believe almost anything,"" Bar-Zeev said. ""The responsibility of everybody in the field is to prevent the bad things as much as possible and foster the good things.""",2021-08-08,tech,CNN
AMC is playing to the Reddit crowd,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.The latest: On the company's earnings call Monday, Aron made it very clear through his choice of words — and downright flattery — that he views retail investors as crucial to the movie theater chain's fortunes.It's not altogether surprising, given that AMC — which had to close all of its cinemas during the peak of the pandemic last year — has been a major beneficiary of the meme stock phenomenon, in which retail investors pour billions of dollars into often troubled companies.The company posted a loss for the three months ended June, but it was narrower than analysts expected and revenue came in ahead of forecasts.""In short, AMC crushed it in Q2,"" Aron said on the call, adopting the Reddit crowd's lingo. Later, Aron highlighted the fact that AMC has implemented some of the ""great ideas"" that individual investors have ""showered"" it with, including screening professional sporting events and concerts.He answered around a dozen questions submitted by individual investors. ""Can you guys make the AMC mascot officially a gorilla?,"" Aaron asked, reflecting the tendency of Reddit investors to refer to each other as ""apes."" ""Would AMC ever consider reestablishing drive-in theaters?,"" Ryan wanted to know.By comparison, Aron took questions from just one analyst — down from about six a year ago — blaming time constraints for cutting it short.The reaction: The stock gained Monday and is up nearly 9% premarket. AMC's newest shareholders raved about Aron's performance on social media platforms such as Reddit afterwards. ""Silverback Adam crushed the earnings call. If you're ""in this to win this"", you should listen to it,"" wrote one observer on Twitter.What it means: Individual investors matter and companies are embracing them for good reason.AMC's stock is up over 1,500% so far this year and it was able to raise $587 million in June as meme traders piled in, even though none of the analysts who cover the company recommend buying the stock and theater attendance remains way below pre-pandemic levels.Watch this space: Playing to another online crowd favorite, AMC announced that it would start rolling out technology to let moviegoers in the United States pay for their tickets and snacks in bitcoin by the end of the year.It is also buying up American theaters and plans to open about a dozen new venues in the United States, Europe and the Middle East this year, betting that consumers will return to the movies once the pandemic subsides.""We fundamentally believe that ours is a future that is bright because there is nothing as magical as seeing dazzling images on a huge silver screen,"" Aron said on the call.Companies have nowhere to hide on climateBusinesses that don't have a plan in place to cut their carbon emissions may soon find themselves on the receiving end of shareholder revolts.What's happening: On Monday, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees — a critical threshold with dire global consequences.The shocking assessment will only increase pressure on companies to scale up climate action in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.""The science is crystal clear but the response is not. Investors must use their influence to push decision makers to make the bold emission reductions required to limit the most severe consequences of climate change,"" Wai-Shin Chan, global head of environmental, social and governance research at HSBC (HSBC), told Reuters.See here: In one of the latest signs of the growing backlash that polluters face, Greenpeace is threatening to sue if Britain green-lights a new crude oil development in the North Sea.The project is co-owned by Siccar Point Energy and Shell (RDSB), which is trying to drum up confidence among shareholders in its plan to make its business greener.

People pursuing this goal start by picking a ""FIRE number,"" which is the amount of money they need to save to generate enough income to cover expenses without having to work.Generally, this means saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt.Bottom line: ""Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,"" explains Danielle R.

SoftBank's CEO went big on China. Now he's pulling back,"The Japanese billionaire said at an earnings presentation Tuesday that he would take a cautious approach until the impact of new regulations are clear.Chinese companies accounted for 23% of SoftBank's massive Vision Fund investment portfolio at the end of July. But only 11% of Vision Fund investment has been directed to the country since April, Son said.""It's because we would like to wait and see a while,"" he added. Taking questions from reporters, Son acknowledged that the company was ""facing tough challenges when it comes to investments in China.""""That's true,"" he said. ""That's something we'd like to be careful about, and be cautious. Once we have a better view, then we'd like to resume [further] investments.""In recent months, China has embarked on a major clampdown on private enterprise, which has engulfed some of the country's top players. Initially, it appeared that regulators' main target was the booming tech sector, but lately that has expanded to reach other industries, such as private education.Investors have been rattled. So far, the events have wiped out more than $1.2 trillion in market value and stoked fears about the future of innovation in the world's second largest economy. Son said he was concerned about the the impact regulations would have on stock markets. SoftBank (SFTBF), one of the world's largest tech investors, holds stakes in several top Chinese firms, including e-commerce titan Alibaba (BABA), ride-hailing giant Didi and TikTok owner ByteDance. Didi has especially felt the pain lately, with an initial public offering in the United States that went downhill after Beijing launched a probe into the company and banned it from Chinese app stores.Son did not comment on Didi specifically during the presentation, but said that he still had ""good expectations"" from SoftBank's portfolio companies in China.He reiterated that the firm wanted to ""wait and see how things go"" as regulations continued to roll out, adding that there was no specific timeline on how long it planned to take that approach.""Is it six months, 12 months? I don't know yet,"" the executive said. ""[But] in one year or two years, under the new rules, and under new orders, I think things will be much clearer ... Once things get clearer, then we are open to resuming active investment.""Son's remarks came as SoftBank posted a nearly 40% drop in profits Tuesday. Net income fell to 761.5 billion yen ($6.9 billion) in the quarter ended June compared to the same period a year ago.The company largely attributed that to a major one-off gain it received last year based on the merger of Sprint (S) — which Son had bought in 2013 — and T-Mobile (TMUS).Despite the crackdown, Son said he remains bullish on China in the long run.""There are still risks out there, like the risks in China. But we want to take risks,"" he said. ""We are not against or for the Chinese government, and we don't have any doubt about [the] future potential of China.""— Laura He contributed to this report.",2021-08-10,investing,CNN
Warren Buffett is buying more of his own stock as Berkshire profits surge,"Berkshire (BRKB) reported strong second quarter earnings on Saturday. Overall profits came in at $28.1 billion in the second quarter, up 7% from the same period a year ago, And Berkshire's net income for the first half of 2021 hit $39.8 billion, reversing a $23.5 billion loss in the first six months of 2020.Operating profits, a measure that Buffett and many analysts and investors prefer to look at as a true measure of Berkshire's health, rebounded sharply as well. The company posted an operating profit of $6.7 billion in the second quarter, a 21% surge from a year ago.Yet Buffett, who has a net worth of nearly $105 billion, continues to be cautious. Berkshire has a giant pile of cash that is growing even bigger as Berkshire looks for more investing opportunities. The company had $144.1 billion on its balance sheet as of the end of June, up from $138.3 billion in December.Although Buffett is famous for making savvy investments in blue chip American companies like Apple (AAPL), Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP), Berkshire has recently been splurging on its own stock. The company disclosed Saturday that it repurchased $6 billion of its shares in the second quarter. It has now bought back $12.6 billion in Berkshire stock so far this year. That's been a good investment as of late. Shares of Berkshire's more affordable B shares, which trade for around $285 and are in the S&P 500, are up 23% this year — outperforming the broader market. The company's A shares (BRKA), which do not split, trade for about $430,000 apiece.  Still, Buffett has long talked about wanting to do one more ""elephant-sized"" acquisition to broaden out the company's portfolio of assets. But make no mistake: Berkshire is doing just fine with what it already owns.Berkshire's railroad, utilities and energy businesses were a big winner in the second quarter, posting a 28% jump in operating earnings. Berkshire owns the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy utility companies.The company's ""other"" business unit, which includes a variety of consumer companies ranging from Dairy Queen and See's Candies to Duracell batteries, Benjamin Moore paints and Fruit of the Loom underwear. In a sign of how important these businesses are to Berkshire, the company announced in May that Greg Abel, the Berkshire vice chairman in charge of the company's non-insurance operations, will succeed the soon to be 91-year old Buffett as Berkshire CEO once he either retires or passes away. Ajit Jain, another Berkshire vice chairman, runs the company's massive insurance unit, which includes auto and home insurance giant Geico. ",2021-08-09,investing,CNN
You might be able to retire earlier than you think. Here's how,"Financial Independence Retire Early -- or FIRE -- is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence and security as early as possible.""The mentality behind the movement is where one strives to live life on their own terms and to get off the proverbial hamster wheel where you are dependent on your employer and have the freedom and security to do so,"" said Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.   That could mean having the financial freedom to change careers, work less or travel the world. So what exactly does the FIRE movement entail? Here's everything you need to know.What is FIRE?The concept of FIRE is based on the notion that retirement is determined by a financial number and not by a person's age. It focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. That means usually saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of your annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt. ""FIRE involves a shift in perspective regarding money and work, prioritizing what is most important to your work-life balance, and making decisions not dictated by the need to earn money but the ultimate goal of financial freedom,"" said AnnaMarie Mock, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser for Highland Financial Advisors. People looking to pursue FIRE typically start by picking what's called a FIRE number, which is the amount of money you'd need to have saved to generate enough income to cover your expenses without having to work.To determine your FIRE number, start off by figuring out your yearly expenses, excluding savings and taxes. From there, calculate how much savings you'll need to generate that much income without having a paycheck. One rule of thumb, known as the 4% rule, says that retirees can safely withdraw about 4% of their savings a year without running out of money. That means saving 25 times your current annual expenses could last indefinitely with regular 4% yearly withdrawals.For example, if your annual expenses are $50,000 per year, you would need at least $1,250,000 ($50,000 x 25) saved when you retire. You can also take a more conservative approach by saving 28 to 33 times your current expenses, and take only 3% to 3.5% withdrawals. From there, try an online calculator to determine how much to save and when you can reach that early nest egg number. Starting as early as possible comes with many advantages. After all, getting a head start on your savings and investments gives your money more time to compound. But even though retiring early requires various sacrifices when it comes to saving and spending, the perks can be rewarding. ""The biggest perk of FIRE is independence,"" said Kevin Chancellor, a certified Social Security claiming strategist and financial adviser. ""If your budget is still sustainable then you have the freedom to travel, be involved in your kid's school activities, start a side business or hobby, and spend more time doing what you want to do rather than what you need to do.""Reaching the magic numberMany people think they don't earn enough to be able to retire early. But there are several methods of reaching FIRE that could help them retire faster than they think. When making the decision to retire early, you should expect to make some significant lifestyle changes. Those changes could be as big as increasing your streams of income or as small as cutting your own hair. It all comes down to either reducing how much you spend or boosting how much you save -- or both. ""Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,"" said Harrison. One way to do that is to drastically slash expenses and live a more frugal and lean lifestyle, which is often the quickest way to FIRE. Known as ""Lean FIRE,"" this typically means having a lower target number for your nest egg and living more modestly in retirement. Those who aren't interested in pinching pennies and have higher-than-average expenses can still retire by increasing their income.Some ways to achieve ""Fat FIRE,"" as it's known, could involve negotiating a higher salary, finding a higher paying job, accumulating sought-after skills, working a side-hustle or owning rental properties. Often, those pursuing Fat FIRE will either choose to work in higher paying professions or take longer to reach their larger savings goal.Some people who want to retire sooner can pursue another method often called ""Barista FIRE."" In this scenario, you can quit your full-time day job once you've stashed away enough retirement savings to grow into a nice nest egg in a few more years without having to add funds. But rather than ceasing work altogether, you work a part-time job, pursue a less lucrative dream career or take on freelance projects in order to cover basic living expenses, all the while allowing your long-term retirement savings to grow until a more traditional retirement age. Is FIRE right for me?Another thing to consider is how you'll spend your time without filling your days with a paid job. For example, will you pursue hobbies, volunteer or travel more? Without a plan in place, you might find that FIRE isn't all you'd hoped it would be.""For anyone retiring, it is important to know what you are retiring to. This is even more important for those looking to retire early,"" said Harrison. ""Figure out what is going to give your life meaning and purpose, so your retirement years can bring you joy.""",2021-08-09,business,CNN
Inflation wiped out America's pay raises,"But those fatter paychecks aren't going as far, thanks to rising inflation. In fact, compensation is now lower than it was in December 2019, when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis by Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University. The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account. (Wages and salaries are growing at a faster pace than benefits.)""The hot economy is heating prices more than it is heating wages,"" said Furman.The index is not subject to the same distortions as other measures, such as average hourly earnings, because it keeps the composition of the workforce constant. The average hourly earnings metric has been swinging during the pandemic as many lower-wage workers lost their jobs initially and are now returning to work.Not counting inflation, compensation rose 2.8% between March and June, despite the relatively high unemployment rate -- a trend that reflects the tight labor market. Job openings are at record-high levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But at the same time, prices are soaring. Gas costs more. Food is more expensive. Car prices are at record levels.The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008, according to federal data.Americans are noticing, raising concerns about the higher prices for homes, cars and household goods, such as appliances, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers released in late July. Still, they generally view the price hikes as short-term, and their improved finances has greatly reduced their resistance to the increases, Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, wrote in the most recent report.Differences by industryInflation-adjusted compensation is down in most industries, but there is one notable exception: Leisure and hospitality. That industry's employers are scrambling to find workers, resulting in a 1.6% bump in pay and benefits since December 2019, according to Furman's analysis.But employees of the utilities industry saw their real compensation slide 1% since December 2019. In education and health services, their real compensation slid 0.8%. Manufacturing fell 0.7% and in transportation and warehousing, real compensation slipped 0.6%.Just how long the steep rise in inflation will last remains a subject of debate. President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve are arguing that it won't be a long-term issue, while some experts worry that the price increases may be more entrenched.But if the inflation growth rate starts to ease, workers will be better able to enjoy their boost in pay.""To the extent that inflation is transitory, this dip in real wages is also transitory,"" said Tim Duy, chief US economist at SGH Macro Advisors, a research firm for the financial industry and policymakers.",2021-08-10,business,CNN
Why big chains aren't requiring vaccines for customers ,"Representatives for retailers and restaurants and HR consultants who work with companies say it's too risky for frontline staff to be put in the position of enforcing vaccine rules for customers. Half of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and pockets of Americans remain resistant or fiercely opposed to getting the shots. There's also the risk that such requirements would alienate customers.Requiring customers to mask up throughout the pandemic has led to confrontations between customers who oppose mask wearing and store staff. Mandating vaccines would be even more challenging for businesses and jeopardize worker safety, industry trade groups say. Instead, large chains are taking different approaches. McDonald's (MCD) is requiring its workers to mask up in high-risk areas and that customers do so as well. Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others are requiring workers to wear masks but only recommending that customers do, too, in high-risk areas. Walmart, Walgreens (WBA) and Gap (GPS) are requiring corporate employees to be vaccinated as they seek to bring people back to the office, but not frontline staff in stores. Walmart, the largest private US employer, has said it hopes that requiring corporate staff to be vaccinated will convince more retail workers to get the shots.""We want to stick with the message that strongly encourages everybody to get vaccinated, but don't want to create a situation where employees basically have a risk of physical assault, because it happened last year,"" said Larry Lynch, senior vice president of science and industry for the National Restaurant Association. ""That's our biggest fear.""David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation, doesn't believe vaccine mandates for customers are the ""right step"" for retail chains, and they would be unable to enforce such mandates.""Store employees are not trained to be security enforcement people,"" he said. ""What do you do if someone says they're coming in and not going to show their vaccination status?""No technology in placeThere are other barriers to vaccine requirements for customers aside from safety concerns, too. Most retail stores ""don't have any experience with requiring things like an ID to come into a store,"" French said, and it would hurt the quality of their customer service to be scrutinizing shoppers' vaccine status. There is no technology in place for retailers to easily check customers' vaccine status nationwide, he said. And then there's the question of what would happen if people forgot their vaccine cards at home or were accompanied by children who are not yet vaccinated.""There are some real practical problems with requiring vaccination status to enter a retail store,"" he said. ""It's something a lot of retailers are scratching their heads at.""Vaccine mandates for customers would also clash with some state and local rules, these industry groups say. Fourteen states have banned so-called vaccine passports — digital apps that allow users to show proof of vaccination before entering events and businesses — according to the National Academy for State Health Policy, a non-profit health policy organization which tracks such data.Companies' decisions on how to approach vaccine rules come as more businesses start to require vaccines for their workers and cities such as New York mandate them for customers to eat indoors and visit gyms. Some New York City restaurants are welcoming the new requirement. They hope that the measure will help avoid another shutdown, and are looking for support from the city to help them put it into place.But for the most part, it's easier for companies to set employment requirements for their own workforce than unfamiliar customers coming in every day, said Craig Rowley, senior client partner specializing in retail at executive search firm Korn Ferry.Public attitude on vaccine mandates for customers is sharply divided, another consideration for businesses.A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,290 adults from July 27 to August 2 found that 52% support requiring proof of vaccination for airline passengers, 49% support vaccine proof for attendees of large sports and entertainment events, and just 37% support proof for restaurant customers.""There are varying opinions on who should be required to prove they have had the vaccine. Yes on proof of vaccination for those who fly, a toss-up for people attending large events, and a no for people going to restaurants,"" said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy.",2021-08-09,business,CNN
JetBlue to launch NY-UK flights despite pandemic,"JetBlue has said the Covid pandemic will not stop the airline from launching its long-awaited New York to London service on Wednesday.Chief executive Robin Hayes told the BBC there was ""strong demand"" for the route in the US where, he said, JetBlue had returned to 2019 levels.The move comes as the global travel industry continues to recover.Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels said holiday demand was ""returning strongly"".In its latest results statement, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), whose other brands include the Crowne Plaza chain, said it had opened 132 hotels during the January-to-June period and acquired another 203, both sizeable increases on last year.""Trading improved significantly during the first half of 2021, with travel demand returning strongly as vaccines roll out, restrictions ease and economic activity rebuilds,"" said IHG chief executive Keith Barr.""It has been great to see our teams welcome more and more guests back into our hotels, with domestic leisure bookings leading the way, particularly in the US and China.""Measured on revenue per available room, nearly half of the group's hotels worldwide were above 2019 levels in July, it said.JetBlue's first transatlantic flight will leave New York's JFK airport on Wednesday evening and will land at London's Heathrow. Flights to London Gatwick will begin on 29 September.However, travelling on the route does not come cheap, at least to start with. JetBlue's website no longer has seats available for that inaugural flight, but prices for the next few days start at $941 (Â£679) one-way.That is still slightly cheaper than British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, which are both quoting a price of $980 for the same time period.Thanks to the likes of those established competitors, there are already as many as 28 flights a day available between London and New York.And other carriers have come a cropper on the same route, including Norwegian Air, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2020 after failing to make its low-cost strategy pay.However, JetBlue will be cutting costs by using smaller aircraft, relying on the single-aisle Airbus A321LR, rather than the Boeing 787 Dreamliners that were favoured by Norwegian.And for those who can book further in advance, it is pledging to offer return fares of less than $600.The airline's Mr Hayes said it had wanted to offer a New York-to-London service for a long time and flights were now ""ready to go"".He said JetBlue wanted to have ""a disruptive and permanent effect"" on the market.US-based travellers are now welcome to fly to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival if they have been fully vaccinated, but there is still a travel ban on people from the UK flying to the US. The White House said at the end of last month that it did not intend to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans.Asked about this, Mr Hayes said JetBlue had made its views clear about the restrictions and that the current approach was ""not risk-based"".",2021-08-10,business,BBC
China sues Tencent over WeChat Youth Mode,"Beijing prosecutors have filed a civil legal action against Tencent over claims its messaging-app WeChat's Youth Mode does not comply with laws protecting minors. Youth Mode prevents younger users from accessing payments, playing certain games and finding nearby friends. However, prosecutors have not specified exactly how the app is allegedly violating Chinese law. Tencent said it would ""investigate"" the claim. ""We will earnestly inspect and check the functions of WeChat Youth Mode, accept user suggestions humbly and sincerely respond to civil public-interest litigation,"" the company posted on Weibo.WeChat, known as Weixin in China, has about 1.26 billion monthly active users.Last week, Chinese authorities called for minors to be better protected from online dangers, with a state-media article labelling games as ""spiritual opium"". Tencent's share price fell by more than 10% shortly after the article was published. And it swiftly announced stricter limits for younger players of its hugely popular game Honour of Kings. Young players can now access the game for only an hour a day on weekdays. Play time in China was previously capped at:The mobile title has more than 100 million users worldwide. In April, it was reported Chinese authorities were preparing a substantial fine for Tencent as part of its efforts to clamp down on internet giants. ",2021-08-09,tech,BBC
Sharing apps are booming but will the kindness continue?,"The pandemic, and lockdown, made Adam Ellison want to help other people.Before coronavirus, he was content with his job in marketing and his own social bubble. But that changed when millions faced hardship due to pandemic disruption caused by the virus. ""I've become more conscious of everybody else,"" he says. ""Some people have had it worse.""In October, he signed up to be a volunteer on Olio, an app that allows people to share edible food waste with others. Every Saturday, Mr Ellison, who lives in a small town near Kilmarnock in Scotland, goes to Tesco at 07:00 to collect unsold produce. Bread, avocados, limes, tomatoes, herbs - it changes every week. He adds whatever items he collects to the app and people who live nearby can request them for pickup. Often, all the food is gone within a day.The number of users on Olio has doubled during the pandemic, from 2 million to 4 million worldwide. It's one of several apps and social media sites that have seen a sharp increase in charitable activity since the emergence of Covid-19.""The demand is just off the chart,"" says Tessa Clarke, Olio's co-founder. The app used to see just under 300,000 food items listed every month. That figure is now roughly 1.6 million, and half of all items are requested by the app's users within 30 minutes of being listed.The boom is partly down to the partnership between Olio and Tesco, which was announced last September. It allows Olio volunteers like Mr Ellison to collect and share food waste not claimed by charities. But Ms Clarke says the pandemic has also motivated people to think differently about food waste - particularly after images of empty supermarket shelves circulated in March last year. ""That led to an almost overnight step-change in terms of people actually valuing food,"" she says. People who claim food on Olio may be facing hunger, or they may simply want to help reduce food waste. Ms Clarke notes that there was, sadly, a noticeable rise in users seeking food for their families via Olio because of a loss of income, or suspension of free school meals.Just a few weeks into redistributing food via the app, Mr Ellison received a message from someone who was particularly in need of food. ""I was in a position where I could actually really help this person,"" he says. ""I can't explain how good that feels, to be able to do that for someone else.""In August, Olio will branch out with a new feature called Borrow, where users will be able to lend people items under a certain value, such as tools. The idea is to reduce the unnecessary purchase of objects that are only used very occasionally. Other apps, such as Freecycle.org and Nextdoor, have also registered a surge in altruistic behaviour during the pandemic.""We went from maybe 60,000 posts a day to 120,000 posts a day overnightâ¦ it was amazing,"" says Deron Beal, founder of Freecycle.org, a website that allows people to offer unwanted possessions to others for free online.The site was flooded with so much activity that Mr Beal's team had to activate additional servers to cope with demand, he adds.Freecycle.org users posted information about the location of vaccination sites, as well as offering home-made cloth masks for free. There was also an increase in listings of food and clothing items.Meanwhile, at Nextdoor, a social network that connects people who live in the same district, there was a 380% increase in posts from UK users that mentioned helping or assisting each another. ""About 70% of our members are still talking about wanting to shop local and supporting local businesses,"" adds Jennie Sager, head of Europe and Australia at Nextdoor.She adds that activity was very high in London, and cites one example of a father and daughter who gave away almost 300 plants for free to their neighbours via Nextdoor.""He thought it would help people reduce their stress,"" says Ms Sager. And the UK Help Map, through which users can offer and find help of various kinds, has received a million unique views. 78,000 people in the country have pinned their locations to the map and offered assistance to their neighbours.While altruistic interventions and acts of kindness have boomed on social apps, cash donations to charities fell during the pandemic, notes Cat Mahoney, research manager at the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF). Online donations rose, however. While they have since fallen again, they remain above pre-pandemic levels.The big question now is whether the broader surge of app-mediated compassion will continue. The influx of posts using terms related to kindness or giving on Nextdoor has been sustained throughout the pandemic, even in countries that have experienced long stretches of very low cases, says Ms Sager. ""When we see neighbourhoods go in and out of lockdown globally, we don't see a massive dip,"" she adds.And at Freecycle.org, some listings - such as free food - have become less common lately, though items people acquired for lockdown hobbies that they no longer need are currently in abundance on the site, says Mr Beal.Dr Oksana Gerwe at Brunel University says that people's familiarity with digital platforms, and their trust in online reviews, may have helped pave the way for online altruism during the pandemic. But she is sceptical that this activity will last unless people form true habits of giving and helping each other regularly. One person who might fit the bill is Mr Ellison. He says his experience of volunteering via Olio has strengthened his belief in the power of communities.""If everybody did something small but meaningful, we'd live in a much, much better society,"" he says. ""I think Covid's been a catalyst for that.""",2021-08-09,business,BBC
TikTok named as the most downloaded app of 2020,"TikTok was the world's most downloaded app in 2020 as it took the top spot from Facebook Messenger, according to digital analytics company App Annie.The Chinese video-sharing platform is the only app not owned by Facebook to make the global top five of downloads.In its home country, TikTok's owner ByteDance also holds the top spot with the Chinese language video app Douyin.TikTok's continued popularity emerged even after former US President Donald Trump tried to ban it in America.Facebook-owned apps have held the top spot since the survey started in 2018 and the company still dominated the chart.Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant accounted for the rest of the top five with Facebook's flagship app as well as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger all making an appearance.Last year, then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order to ban new downloads of the TikTok app in the US.The Trump administration claimed that TikTok posed a national security risk as the Chinese government had access to its user data. The company repeatedly denied the allegations.A potential deal to resolve the issue that would have seen parent company ByteDance selling part of its US business to US technology giant Oracle and retailer Walmart was given the tentative green light from Mr Trump but was never approved by the Chinese government.Since becoming US President in January this year Joe Biden has withdrawn Mr Trump's executive order.As well as seeing off that challenge in the US the company has been exploring new ways to attract users.Last week, it emerged that TikTok is trialling a new vanishing clips feature similar to functions on Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram.TikTok Stories will allow users to see content posted by accounts they follow for 24 hours before they are deleted.It came after WhatsApp rolled out a feature for users to post photos or videos that vanish after they are seen.",2021-08-10,business,BBC
US job vacancies hit a record 10.1 million,"US job openings hit a fresh record in June amid reports the country continues to face a labour shortage. Job vacancies jumped by 590,000 to 10.1 million on the last day of the month, according to figures from the Labor Department.That was up from a record 9.5 million openings in May and well above economists' expectations.It comes as companies struggle to find workers in sectors such as leisure and hospitality as the economy reopens.""The ratio of openings to hires, despite easing in June, remained at historically elevated levels,"" JPMorgan analyst Peter McCrory said.US unemployment surged to 14.8% at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but the economy has been recovering strongly this year. However, despite restrictions being eased, workers have not rushed back to jobs in the numbers expected. The shortfall has been blamed on a lack of affordable childcare, generous unemployment benefits, and pandemic-related retirements and career changes.Some also believe there are too many low-skilled jobs being advertised, and not enough suitable candidates.Official unemployment figures in July suggested the country might be turning a corner, as employment rose by 943,000. The unemployment rate also fell 0.5 percentage points to 5.4%.However the figures mainly pre-date the rise of the Delta variant of Covid in the US, which has led to a surge in infections and fears new restrictions could be imposed.Already New York City has said all customers and staff of restaurants, gyms and other indoor businesses will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.And the city's Auto Show, scheduled to run from 20 to 29 August, has been cancelled due to fears about rising infection rates.  Figures from the Labor Department showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in June increased to 3.9 million from 3.6 million in May, well above pre-pandemic levels.However, in a positive sign hiring rose to 6.7 million from 6 million in the previous month, the second largest increase since the government started tracking the data in 2000. The largest increases in vacancies in June were in professional and business services, retail, and accommodation and food services.Some economists believe hiring will pick up further as schools reopen in September and more states phase out emergency unemployment benefits.   Economists are also increasingly confident that US unemployment levels will reach pre-pandemic levels next year, with Goldman Sachs projecting a rate of 3.5% by the end of 2022.",2021-08-09,business,BBC
Apple defends new photo scanning child protection tech,"Apple has defended its new system that scans users' phones for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), after a backlash from customers and privacy advocates. The technology searches for matches of known abuse material before the image is uploaded to its iCloud storage.Critics warned it could be a ""backdoor"" to spy on people, and more than 5,000 people and organisations have signed an open letter against the technology. As a result, Apple has pledged not to ""expand"" the system for any reason.Digital privacy campaigners warned last week that authoritarian governments could use the technology to bolster anti-LGBT regimes, or crack down on political dissidents in countries where protests are deemed illegal.But Apple said it would ""will not accede to any government's request to expand"" the system.It published a question-and-answer document, saying it had numerous safeguards in place to stop its systems from being used for anything other than the detection of child abuse imagery. ""We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future,"" it said.However, Apple has made some concessions in the past in order to keep operating in countries around the world. Last New Year's Eve, the tech giant removed 39,000 apps from its Chinese App Store amid a crackdown on unlicensed games by authorities in the country. Apple also said its anti-CSAM tool will not allow the company to see or scan a user's photo album. It will only scan photos that are shared on iCloud.The system will look for matches, securely on the device, based on a database of hashes of known CSAM images provided by child safety organisations.Apple also claims it is nearly impossible to falsely flag innocent people to police. ""The likelihood that the system would incorrectly flag any given account is less than one in one trillion per year,"" it said. There is also a human review of positive matches.Privacy advocates, however, have argued that the only thing preventing that technology being turned to other uses is Apple's promise that it will not be.Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for example, said that ""all it would take... is an expansion of the machine learning parameters to look for additional types of content"".""That's not a slippery slope; that's a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change,"" it warned.Apple also provided reassurances regarding another new feature that will warn children and their parents using linked family accounts, when sexually explicit photos are sent or received. The company says its two new features do not use the same technology, and says it will ""never"" gain access to users' private communications. While there was a backlash regarding Apple's announcement from privacy advocates, some politicians welcomed the new technology. UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it was time for others, especially Facebook, to follow suit.",2021-08-09,tech,BBC
Paddy Power owner revenue soars amid online gambling boom,"Paddy Power-owner Flutter has said its UK betting shop revenue has jumped higher than pre-Covid levels.Betting shops were closed during lockdowns but since reopening in June, Flutter said UK retail revenue rose 7% ahead of sales before the pandemic.Like its rivals, Flutter has seen strong growth in online gambling as shops closed and people were forced to work from home.But one gambling helpline said calls had risen by 9% in the year to March.And punters came back to betting shops after they re-opened as Covid restrictions eased in the second quarter, with UK retail revenue 7% higher than pre-Covid levels, it said.The number of people using Flutter's online gambling in the UK leapt even more, increasing nearly 60%.A UK gambling helpline said calls had increased by 9% in the year to the end of March.Flutter said global revenue rose 28% to Â£3bn as its average number of gamblers rose 40% to more than 7.5 million.Chief executive Peter Jackson said: ""The first half of 2021 exceeded our expectations as we made substantial progress against our operational and strategic objectives while maintaining excellent momentum in growing our player base.""Many countries around the world closed down betting shops during coronavirus lockdowns, and gamblers shifted their focus online.Flutter attracted new customers during lockdowns, and kept hold of many of them in the first half, said Alistair Johnson, analyst at Redburn.Studies have suggested that online gambling soared during coronavirus lockdowns, with vulnerable groups particularly at risk.In the UK, Flutter, which owns brands such as Betfair and Sky Betting and Gaming, said it had 59% more online customers than in the same period in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis.Overall, its UK and Ireland average monthly numbers grew 44% to 3.3 million customers. This outpaced revenue growth of 30% - so on average, revenue per active customer was lower, it said.Flutter has been pouring money into its US business, spending more than $1bn to date on marketing its flagship FanDuel sports betting brand.US revenues were more than $900m in the first half, putting distance between it and its main rivals, it said.The gambling giant competed its acquisition of Canadian gambling business the Stars Group on 5 May 2020.Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd said the pandemic ""lent a helping hand to online betting, speeding up its transition to digital"".She said US revenue growth, which soared by 159% to Â£652m, was ""driven by six additional states legalising sports betting"".""As vaccination ramps up and Flutter's main markets return to business-as-usual, it may be ill-prepared for lockdowns easing,"" Ms Boothroyd added.Last year a House of Lords report found that there were a third of a million problem gamblers in the UK, with young people being most at risk.The amount of harm was wider, though.

Marlboro owner wants to buy a company that makes asthma inhalers. Health charities say it must be stopped,"Marlboro maker Philip Morris International (PMI) on Sunday increased its offer for pharmaceutical company Vectura to more than £1 billion ($1.4 billion) in an attempt to fend off a rival bid from US private equity group Carlyle. The revised offer comes just weeks after the tobacco giant said it will stop selling Marlboro cigarettes in Britain within a decade. In a statement, Philip Morris International (PM) said it had increased its bid for Vectura to £1.65 ($2.29) per share, valuing the asthma inhaler maker at £1.02 billion ($1.4 billion).The deal would boost the tobacco giant's ambition to generate more than half of its net revenue from smoke-free products such as e-cigarettes and respiratory drugs within four years, up from about a quarter today. PMI currently sells cigarettes in more than 175 markets.Vectura has manufactured 13 inhaled medicines for companies such as Novartis (NVS) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to treat lung conditions including asthma. It is currently working on an inhalation treatment for Covid-19 with Inspira Pharmaceuticals, another UK company.""PMI intends to operate Vectura as an autonomous business unit that will form the backbone of PMI's inhaled therapeutics business,"" Philip Morris International said. Tobacco companies are under pressure to diversify amid dwindling smoker numbers, a push from governments to reduce the prevalence and dangers of smoking, and moves by investors to strip tobacco products from their portfolios.Philip Morris International has invested $8 billion and hired dozens of scientists and technicians to develop alternatives to cigarettes, including its flagship IQOS product, which heats rather than burns tobacco.The company also recently bought Fertin Pharma, which manufactures oral drugs to treat pain, allergies and various other ailments.Philip Morris International was separated from New York-listed Altria (MO) in 2008. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, which sells cigarette brands including Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Parliament and Merit in the United States.Deal backlashHealth charities are skeptical of Philip Morris International's plans and have urged the UK government to block the Vectura deal, warning it will allow the tobacco industry to influence public health policy in Britain.""It's ironic that a tobacco company wants to invest in the lung health industry when their products are the biggest preventable cause of cancer, including lung cancer,"" Cancer Research UK's chief executive Michelle Mitchell said in a statement last month. ""If PMI really wanted to help, they could stop aggressively promoting and selling their products altogether,"" she added.In a letter to the UK government, Cancer Research UK, the British Lung Foundation and Action on Smoking and Health said there is ""huge unease"" that a tobacco company could profit from treatments for conditions such as asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.""There is a real prospect that PMI will use this acquisition to legitimise tobacco industry participation in health debates within the UK. This must not be allowed to happen,"" the organizations said, calling on the government to intervene.Philip Morris' revised offer came just two days after Carlyle raised its own bid for Vectura to £1.55 ($2.15) per share. Vectura had on Friday recommended the Carlyle offer to shareholders, voicing concerns around being owned by Philip Morris and saying it may be ""better positioned under Carlyle ownership."" The company on Monday said it was withdrawing that recommendation but had no intention yet to recommend the Philip Morris International offer.The takeover battle will enter an auction process if the rival bidders do not make final offers by Tuesday, according to British regulators.",2021-08-09,business,CNN
