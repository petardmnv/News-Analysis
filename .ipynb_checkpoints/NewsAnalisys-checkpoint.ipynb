       " 'The China Passenger Car Association reported that Tesla\\'s sales in China fell to 8,621 cars in July, down nearly 70% from June. But the export of cars built at Tesla\\'s Shanghai plant jumped to 24,347 for July, compared with 5,017 in June. That means total sales of Chinese-built Teslas fell less than 1% overall. Critics say the steep decline of sales to Chinese consumers is yet another sign of the growing problems the company faces in the country. Tesla is contending with increased competition from Chinese EV makers as well as a run of bad publicity, including a recall of virtually all of the cars that have been built in Shanghai. The company also faced protests by Telsa owners at this year\\'s Shanghai auto show over poor car quality and various safety concerns flagged by Chinese regulators.Teslas accounted for just 3.9% of July sales of battery electric vehicles in China, down from 12.6% in June, said analyst Gordon Johnson, who has been among the harshest critics of the company. He said that decline shows Tesla is facing fiercer competition from local EV startups.\"Overall, it now seems clear that Tesla has overbuilt Chinese capacity when compared to domestic demand, which will result in further price cuts and margin pressure,\" Johnson said. \"Given China is supposed to be Tesla\\'s \\'growth market,\\' these numbers should concern any Tesla bull.\"But Tesla (TSLA) investors seemed unfazed by the sales dip, as shares declined less than 1% Tuesday. That\\'s in sharp contrast to the steeper drops in the stock price following similar weak reports from the CPCA in April and May.Last month investors saw that declining numbers in China didn\\'t stop Tesla from reporting better than expected global sales for the full quarter, said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull.\"I think investors are becoming less sensitive to the month-to-month China numbers,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it\\'s not been the best indicator of Tesla\\'s success, as we saw in the second quarter.\"But Ives said that if Tesla\\'s sales in China don\\'t improve, the company could face serious problems going forward.\"Right now we believe that China will be 40% of deliveries for Tesla by next year,\" he said. \"So selling only 8,000 in a month, even though it\\'s a volatile number, it doesn\\'t give the bulls the warm and fuzzies.\"Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not breakdown sales by market and only reports sales quarterly, not monthly. So the numbers from the CPCA are not confirmed. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.-- Laura He contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'Financial Independence Retire Early -- or FIRE -- is a method of living below your means to obtain financial independence and security as early as possible.\"The mentality behind the movement is where one strives to live life on their own terms and to get off the proverbial hamster wheel where you are dependent on your employer and have the freedom and security to do so,\" said Danielle R. Harrison, founder and president at Harrison Financial Planning.   That could mean having the financial freedom to change careers, work less or travel the world. So what exactly does the FIRE movement entail? Here\\'s everything you need to know.What is FIRE?The concept of FIRE is based on the notion that retirement is determined by a financial number and not by a person\\'s age. It focuses on keeping expenses low and savings high. That means usually saving anywhere between 50% to 75% of your annual income to retire well before the age of 65 and usually without any debt. \"FIRE involves a shift in perspective regarding money and work, prioritizing what is most important to your work-life balance, and making decisions not dictated by the need to earn money but the ultimate goal of financial freedom,\" said AnnaMarie Mock, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser for Highland Financial Advisors. People looking to pursue FIRE typically start by picking what\\'s called a FIRE number, which is the amount of money you\\'d need to have saved to generate enough income to cover your expenses without having to work.To determine your FIRE number, start off by figuring out your yearly expenses, excluding savings and taxes. From there, calculate how much savings you\\'ll need to generate that much income without having a paycheck. One rule of thumb, known as the 4% rule, says that retirees can safely withdraw about 4% of their savings a year without running out of money. That means saving 25 times your current annual expenses could last indefinitely with regular 4% yearly withdrawals.For example, if your annual expenses are $50,000 per year, you would need at least $1,250,000 ($50,000 x 25) saved when you retire. You can also take a more conservative approach by saving 28 to 33 times your current expenses, and take only 3% to 3.5% withdrawals. From there, try an online calculator to determine how much to save and when you can reach that early nest egg number. Starting as early as possible comes with many advantages. After all, getting a head start on your savings and investments gives your money more time to compound. But even though retiring early requires various sacrifices when it comes to saving and spending, the perks can be rewarding. \"The biggest perk of FIRE is independence,\" said Kevin Chancellor, a certified Social Security claiming strategist and financial adviser. \"If your budget is still sustainable then you have the freedom to travel, be involved in your kid\\'s school activities, start a side business or hobby, and spend more time doing what you want to do rather than what you need to do.\"Reaching the magic numberMany people think they don\\'t earn enough to be able to retire early. But there are several methods of reaching FIRE that could help them retire faster than they think. When making the decision to retire early, you should expect to make some significant lifestyle changes. Those changes could be as big as increasing your streams of income or as small as cutting your own hair. It all comes down to either reducing how much you spend or boosting how much you save -- or both. \"Those looking to retire early need to widen the gap between what they earn and what they spend,\" said Harrison. One way to do that is to drastically slash expenses and live a more frugal and lean lifestyle, which is often the quickest way to FIRE. Known as \"Lean FIRE,\" this typically means having a lower target number for your nest egg and living more modestly in retirement. Those who aren\\'t interested in pinching pennies and have higher-than-average expenses can still retire by increasing their income.Some ways to achieve \"Fat FIRE,\" as it\\'s known, could involve negotiating a higher salary, finding a higher paying job, accumulating sought-after skills, working a side-hustle or owning rental properties. Often, those pursuing Fat FIRE will either choose to work in higher paying professions or take longer to reach their larger savings goal.Some people who want to retire sooner can pursue another method often called \"Barista FIRE.\" In this scenario, you can quit your full-time day job once you\\'ve stashed away enough retirement savings to grow into a nice nest egg in a few more years without having to add funds. But rather than ceasing work altogether, you work a part-time job, pursue a less lucrative dream career or take on freelance projects in order to cover basic living expenses, all the while allowing your long-term retirement savings to grow until a more traditional retirement age. Is FIRE right for me?Another thing to consider is how you\\'ll spend your time without filling your days with a paid job. For example, will you pursue hobbies, volunteer or travel more? Without a plan in place, you might find that FIRE isn\\'t all you\\'d hoped it would be.\"For anyone retiring, it is important to know what you are retiring to. This is even more important for those looking to retire early,\" said Harrison. \"Figure out what is going to give your life meaning and purpose, so your retirement years can bring you joy.\"',\n",
       " 'On NBC, Jimmy Fallon led with the news of the stunning announcement. \"During his remarks, he said it was best he step aside,\" the host said. \"And then every woman in the room took two steps aside.\" He later joked that Cuomo\\'s future is going to be \"tough\" with his only two options being president or Supreme Court justice.Over on CBS, Stephen Colbert said it was a \"beautiful day\" in New York because of Cuomo\\'s resignation. \"Don\\'t let the door hit you on the butt on the way out. But if it does, that door should should also resign,\" the comedian joked. Colbert also took aim at Cuomo\\'s lack of ownership of his actions, notably the state attorney general finding that he had sexually harassed 11 women. During Tuesday\\'s press conference, Cuomo said that in his opinion, he had \"never crossed the line with anyone, but I didn\\'t realize the extent to which the line had been redrawn.\" Colbert responded: \"I don\\'t know what line exactly he\\'s talking about, but hopefully he\\'ll explain in his new book \\'Andrew and the Purple Crayon.\\' Warning that\\'s not a crayon in his hand, but it is purple.\" Filling in for Jimmy Kimmel on ABC, guest host David Spade said it\\'s his last show filling in for Kimmel and then he\\'s heading to Hooters with Cuomo. Later on NBC, Seth Meyers brought on Amy Poehler to have a discussion about Cuomo\\'s news. The pair talked about the numerous ways Cuomo\\'s says he greets people and decided that most of them were problematic.\"The only person allowed to pat my face is my plastic surgeon,\" Poehler joked.',\n",
       " 'In the coming weeks, Britain\\'s oil regulator could decide whether to green-light the Cambo development near the Shetland Islands, which co-owners Shell (RDSA) and Blackstone-backed Siccar Point Energy expect to produce 164 million barrels of crude during the first phase of development.But environmental groups and other activists are furious. They claim that approving the development would damage the environment and undermine claims by the UK government that it\\'s taking bold action ahead of November\\'s 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow.\"We will know if politicians are listening if the UK government, as hosts of COP who aspire to lead on climate, call time and put a stop to Cambo,\" said Tessa Khan, a climate lawyer who leads the advocacy group Uplift.The political fight underscores the challenges facing governments and businesses as they strive to meet net-zero emissions goals aimed at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is essential to maintaining a livable planet. On Monday, the United Nations\\' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned the world has rapidly warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial era levels, and is now careening toward 1.5 degrees. Yet the world remains reliant on oil and gas, and companies like Shell are working to provide it. To reach net-zero emissions by 2050, however, no new oil or gas fields can be approved for development, the International Energy Agency warned earlier this year.\"If we reduce the consumption of oil in line with what is needed to reach [the 2050] targets, we will not need to invest in new oil or gas exploration or new coal mining. Very clear,\" Fatih Birol, the IEA\\'s executive director, said in a recent interview on Cambo with the UK\\'s Channel 4. The UK government, he added, should choose to be an \"inspiration for the rest of the world.\"The Cambo oilfieldThe Cambo oilfield is a key project for Shell, which holds a 30% stake, and Siccar Point, which controls 70% of the venture.\"It\\'ll be important for both of them because there are so few developments now [in the North Sea],\" said Alexander Kemp, a professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen.Discovered in 2002, the field could contain over 800 million barrels of heavy crude. Deepwater drilling is expected to start in 2022, with oil production kicking off in 2025 and running until 2050.\"It\\'s a significant size field by today\\'s standards,\" said Kemp, noting that a more typical development would yield about 20 million barrels, not 164 million. But the project has stoked the ire of a coalition of environmental advocates, who are ramping up political pressure by highlighting the optics of approving the development so close to COP26. The oil produced will have the same climate footprint as running about 18 coal-fired power stations for a year, Uplift has calculated.\"The proposed new Cambo oilfield is a clear climate contradiction,\" Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said in a statement this month. \"If the UK government is to be a credible broker for a deal that can stop the planet overheating when it hosts the COP26 climate talks in November it must intervene in the Cambo case.\"The IEA\\'s net-zero roadmap published in May is another flash point. The report plainly states that as of 2021, no new oil and gas fields can be developed in order to reach climate targets. Uplift\\'s Khan said this is \"the first major test\" since the warning was issued.A looming decisionThe UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is expected to imminently decide whether to allow the development to proceed.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told local media late last week that the choice is up to the regulator and \"no contracts should be ripped up.\" Greenpeace has said if the OGA moves ahead, it could sue. The activist group takes particular issue with the government\\'s announcement that it will require new \"climate compatibility checkpoints\" on future oil and gas licensing rounds to make sure they\\'re in line with the United Kingdom\\'s pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050. That doesn\\'t apply to Cambo, since a license was already issued in 2001 when exploration of the area began. Greenpeace has called this a deliberate \"loophole.\"Alok Sharma, the lawmaker appointed by the UK government to lead COP26, did not directly address whether North Sea oil production contradicts UK climate goals when asked by reporters Monday, saying that the government was \"going to be very rigorously applying a climate compatibility check\" for \"future\" oil and gas licenses.There\\'s reason to believe the OGA will push forward with the project, even if it generates backlash.The agency has emphasized that even under net-zero plans, oil and gas will remain crucial sources of energy for the country, and that it\\'s closely monitoring emissions for all projects to make sure they align with the 2050 goal.\"Oil and gas still make up around three quarters of the UK\\'s energy consumption,\" Chairman Tim Eggar wrote in the agency\\'s latest annual report. \"They are forecast to be needed now and into the future; not just for heating, transport and power generation, but also as a feedstock for manufacturing other materials such as chemicals, medicines and more.\"Shell and Siccar Point\\'s roleThis position is echoed by those in the oil industry who believe that based on the United Kingdom\\'s ongoing energy requirements, the focus on Cambo is overdone.\"Fields like Cambo meet the UK\\'s energy needs, and producing it here means we can reduce emissions associated with production as much as possible,\" said Deirdre Michie, CEO of industry group Oil & Gas UK. \"A premature ending of domestic production would mean we simply need to import more of it from other countries, at great expense, while losing all control of the environmental standards for how it was produced.\"In response to questions from CNN Business, Siccar Point Energy CEO Jonathan Roger said that Cambo would directly create 1,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, and that the oilfield will be built using \"modern, low-emission equipment and manufacturing processes and be electrification ready, with the potential to be powered by renewable energy when that\\'s feasible.\"Shell emphasized that its oil production peaked in 2019 and is expected to continue to decline until 2030.\"We\\'re already investing billions of dollars in low-carbon energy,\" a company spokesperson said. \"But the world will still need oil and gas for decades to come in sectors that can\\'t be easily decarbonized. Targeted investment in oil and gas will ensure we can supply the energy people will still rely on, while funding the rapid growth of our low-carbon businesses.\"But like the UK government, industry players are walking a tightrope.There are, of course, business considerations at play. The United Kingdom is one of nine core markets that Shell has identified for energy exploration and production. In a report to investors, the Anglo-Dutch company estimated average investment returns of 20% to 25% for similar projects across its portfolio. Siccar Point said investment in the Cambo project will total about £1.9 billion ($2.6 billion) and £140 million ($194 million) has already been put up. It declined to comment on expected returns.Meanwhile, investors are asking more from oil companies as they increasingly weigh environmental and social concerns — as are the courts.In May, a Dutch judge ordered Shell to slash its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels in a landmark climate decision. That would require the company, which is currently targeting a 45% reduction in carbon intensity by 2035, to speed up its transition plan.Shell is appealing the ruling, which it says risks shifting demand to suppliers that are less concerned about reducing their emissions impact. But the Cambo debate reveals the firm\\'s tough road ahead. On one hand, Shell wants to drum up confidence in plans to make its business greener. And yet, at its core, it\\'s still a corporation that produces oil and gas. That\\'s not going to change anytime soon.',\n",
       " 'The Japanese billionaire said at an earnings presentation Tuesday that he would take a cautious approach until the impact of new regulations are clear.Chinese companies accounted for 23% of SoftBank\\'s massive Vision Fund investment portfolio at the end of July. But only 11% of Vision Fund investment has been directed to the country since April, Son said.\"It\\'s because we would like to wait and see a while,\" he added. Taking questions from reporters, Son acknowledged that the company was \"facing tough challenges when it comes to investments in China.\"\"That\\'s true,\" he said. \"That\\'s something we\\'d like to be careful about, and be cautious. Once we have a better view, then we\\'d like to resume [further] investments.\"In recent months, China has embarked on a major clampdown on private enterprise, which has engulfed some of the country\\'s top players. Initially, it appeared that regulators\\' main target was the booming tech sector, but lately that has expanded to reach other industries, such as private education.Investors have been rattled. So far, the events have wiped out more than $1.2 trillion in market value and stoked fears about the future of innovation in the world\\'s second largest economy. Son said he was concerned about the the impact regulations would have on stock markets. SoftBank (SFTBF), one of the world\\'s largest tech investors, holds stakes in several top Chinese firms, including e-commerce titan Alibaba (BABA), ride-hailing giant Didi and TikTok owner ByteDance. Didi has especially felt the pain lately, with an initial public offering in the United States that went downhill after Beijing launched a probe into the company and banned it from Chinese app stores.Son did not comment on Didi specifically during the presentation, but said that he still had \"good expectations\" from SoftBank\\'s portfolio companies in China.He reiterated that the firm wanted to \"wait and see how things go\" as regulations continued to roll out, adding that there was no specific timeline on how long it planned to take that approach.\"Is it six months, 12 months? I don\\'t know yet,\" the executive said. \"[But] in one year or two years, under the new rules, and under new orders, I think things will be much clearer ... Once things get clearer, then we are open to resuming active investment.\"Son\\'s remarks came as SoftBank posted a nearly 40% drop in profits Tuesday. Net income fell to 761.5 billion yen ($6.9 billion) in the quarter ended June compared to the same period a year ago.The company largely attributed that to a major one-off gain it received last year based on the merger of Sprint (S) — which Son had bought in 2013 — and T-Mobile (TMUS).Despite the crackdown, Son said he remains bullish on China in the long run.\"There are still risks out there, like the risks in China. But we want to take risks,\" he said. \"We are not against or for the Chinese government, and we don\\'t have any doubt about [the] future potential of China.\"— Laura He contributed to this report.',\n",
       " 'But those fatter paychecks aren\\'t going as far, thanks to rising inflation. In fact, compensation is now lower than it was in December 2019, when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis by Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard University. The Employment Cost Index — which measures wages and salaries, along with health, retirement and other benefits — fell in the last quarter and is 2% below its pre-pandemic trend, when taking inflation into account. (Wages and salaries are growing at a faster pace than benefits.)\"The hot economy is heating prices more than it is heating wages,\" said Furman.The index is not subject to the same distortions as other measures, such as average hourly earnings, because it keeps the composition of the workforce constant. The average hourly earnings metric has been swinging during the pandemic as many lower-wage workers lost their jobs initially and are now returning to work.Not counting inflation, compensation rose 2.8% between March and June, despite the relatively high unemployment rate -- a trend that reflects the tight labor market. Job openings are at record-high levels, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.But at the same time, prices are soaring. Gas costs more. Food is more expensive. Car prices are at record levels.The consumer price index rose 0.9% in June and 5.4% over the past 12 months — the largest jumps for each since mid-2008, according to federal data.Americans are noticing, raising concerns about the higher prices for homes, cars and household goods, such as appliances, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers released in late July. Still, they generally view the price hikes as short-term, and their improved finances has greatly reduced their resistance to the increases, Richard Curtin, the survey\\'s chief economist, wrote in the most recent report.Differences by industryInflation-adjusted compensation is down in most industries, but there is one notable exception: Leisure and hospitality. That industry\\'s employers are scrambling to find workers, resulting in a 1.6% bump in pay and benefits since December 2019, according to Furman\\'s analysis.But employees of the utilities industry saw their real compensation slide 1% since December 2019. In education and health services, their real compensation slid 0.8%. Manufacturing fell 0.7% and in transportation and warehousing, real compensation slipped 0.6%.Just how long the steep rise in inflation will last remains a subject of debate. President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve are arguing that it won\\'t be a long-term issue, while some experts worry that the price increases may be more entrenched.But if the inflation growth rate starts to ease, workers will be better able to enjoy their boost in pay.\"To the extent that inflation is transitory, this dip in real wages is also transitory,\" said Tim Duy, chief US economist at SGH Macro Advisors, a research firm for the financial industry and policymakers.',\n",
       " 'The breakthrough is significant for two reasons: 1) Negotiators were able to reach a bipartisan consensus. 2) It deals with a largely new industry, which uses blockchain technology for online transactions.A lead negotiator, Sen. Pat Toomey, put it more bluntly on Monday, describing cryptocurrency as \"an issue that has been vexing us.\" Another lead negotiator, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, called it \"such a new subject to so many people in the US Senate.\"The Senate\\'s average age is 64.3 years -- older than the House\\'s 58.4 years, according to the Library of Congress. And among US investors over 50, 76% say they haven\\'t even heard of cryptocurrencies, according to a recent Gallup poll.A last-minute cryptocurrency tax provision was tacked on to the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill last week, which complicated infrastructure negotiations as a bitter dispute emerged over proposed tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions.

On Monday, Toomey and Lummis announced an amendment to the provision, negotiated with the Treasury Department, focused on regulating digital assets by requiring brokers to report their transactions.The negotiating group also included Sens. Rob Portman, a Republican, and Democrats Mark Warner and Kyrsten Sinema.\\xa0\"The silver lining is we found out who in the Senate is interested in this subject who maybe previously didn\\'t know anything about\" cryptocurrencies, Lummis said. The Wyoming Republican added: \"We were finally able to illustrate that there\\'s a lot of people interested in digital assets and now have contact with their senator.\"American investors already are showing increasing interest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

That\\'s up from just 2% who said the same in May 2018. That number climbs even higher, to 13%, for investors under 50 years old.Gallup likens current Bitcoin ownership levels to gold, which 11% of investors say they own.Lummis acknowledged the \"space is moving so fast, the innovation is working at such a rapid rate that we will probably have to revisit this subject,\" and called the amendment \"legislation that sets some definitions in this space.\"The Point: Bipartisan negotiators took on the largely new-to-them frontier of cryptocurrency and made a deal -- expanding our definition of \"infrastructure\" once again to keep up with the times.',\n",
       " 'SkyCool Systems is trying to break that vicious cycle, using technology that promises to offer buildings an alternative means to cool down by essentially mimicking how the planet cools itself.\"Our planet naturally cools itself by sending heat out in the form of infrared light or radiation,\" said Eli Goldstein, SkyCool\\'s cofounder and CEO, through a process known as radiative cooling.\"We\\'re using that effect to essentially radiate heat out and out during the day and at night, even under direct sunlight.\" The five-year-old company said it does this through rooftop panels made using nanotechnology. These panels consist of an optical film that radiates infrared light and cools itself in the process. They resemble solar panels but actually do the opposite, reflecting 97% of the sunlight that hits them and cooling the surface below, according to the company.SkyCool\\'s model involves embedding a network of pipes below those panels. These pipes are filled with water, which is kept cool by the panels and then flows into a refrigeration or air conditioning system. This process is designed to take pressure off the system\\'s cooling mechanism. And because the panels cool naturally and don\\'t need external power to function, it helps the entire system use less electricity. A Grocery Outlet store in Stockton, California, which has been using SkyCool\\'s system since last year, says it saw a marked drop in its electrical bills.\"After we had our SkyCool system installed, our electricity company increased their rates on us,\" Jesus Valenzuela, the store manager, told CNN Business. \"We actually didn\\'t see our bill go up at all. In fact, we saw it go just a little bit down,\" he added. Valenzuela estimates that the panels have saved his store roughly $3,000 a month.Scientists have been researching the benefits of radiative cooling for years, including Goldstein\\'s co-founder and UCLA professor Aaswath Raman, who is a pioneer in the field. Several solutions and models to harness the process have been proposed in recent months.But there are some challenges, including a constraint familiar to the solar industry: it doesn\\'t work as well without sunlight.\"Our technology works best in hot, dry climates where the sky is clear, so when you have clouds, that blocks that radiative cooling window,\" Goldstein said. \"In the same way that [carbon dioxide] blocks light and sort of has that heat trapping effect, water vapor also will block infrared light.\" But perhaps the biggest obstacle to making the technology ubiquitous is its relatively high cost. Most radiative cooling solutions \"suffer from a high manufacturing cost and large-scale production limits,\" researchers at China\\'s Fudan University wrote in a paper published in the journal Nature earlier this year. Goldstein declined to reveal exactly how much SkyCool\\'s panels cost but acknowledged that they are currently \"more expensive\" than solar panels.\"New technologies like radiative cooling are often more expensive,\" he said. \"People are very sensitive to first cost, and so that is another barrier to getting new things out there.\"Much of that is because of low production volumes, he said. Scaling up production could help bring the cost down, Goldstein said, particularly for developing countries in Asia and Africa where SkyCool hopes to eventually expand. For now, the company is focused on commercial applications of the technology, though it hopes to start installing panels on the roofs of individual homes. It has installed panels at other locations around California, including a retail store and a data center. \"We\\'re just excited to be able to use this new technology for good,\" Goldstein said.',\n",
       " 'Starting September 13, employees working in the bank\\'s New York headquarters as well as other offices in the New York metropolitan area, Chicago, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia, will need to be vaccinated and are expected in the office at least twice a week. For employees working at other branches, Citi (CPRJ) is strongly encouraging, but not requiring, vaccination. Those employees are required to wear masks and participate in company-provided rapid testing regardless of vaccination status. The bank said it is monitoring data but will not be bringing more employees back to any other corporate offices yet. Unlike other Wall Street banks, Citi\\'s executives have been accepting of hybrid work. In March, the company recognized that hybrid work had been beneficial for some employees and promised to embrace flexibility when returning to the office.Joining the trendThe decision to mandate vaccinations adds Citi to a growing list of companies mandating vaccines for employees, and in some cases, customers.Morgan Stanley (AANXX) in June banned all unvaccinated staff, clients and guests from its New York office. All employees who work in buildings with a \"large employee presence\" were required to confirm their vaccination status by July 1, according to a company memo to employees. Jefferies (JEF) made a similar move, allowing only vaccinated vaccinated employees into the office, according to a memo the company\\'s CEO and president sent to employees. Workers not fully vaccinated by Labor Day \"should continue to work from home,\" the memo said.Other companies mandating vaccines for corporate employees include Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Blackrock (BAAPX), Walmart (WMT) and Disney (DIS). Aside from just businesses, New York City is requiring proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, fitness centers and indoor entertainment, Mayor Bill DeBlasio announced August 3. \"If you\\'re unvaccinated, unfortunately, you will not be able to participate in many things,\" de Blasio said. \"If you want to participate in our society fully, you\\'ve got to get vaccinated.\" ',\n",
       " 'It\\'s way too soon to make that call. But notably, shares of Robinhood debuted at $38 — the same price as Facebook (FB) in its May 2012 IPO. Today Facebook is trading at nearly $361.Robinhood has certainly had a rollercoaster ride so far: The stock tumbled 8% on its first day and fell as low as $33.25 the second day. But it\\'s since roared back up to more than 40% above the IPO price and is now trading around $54, even briefly hitting a high of $85 last week. It\\'s why some observers are labeling Robinhood a so-called meme stock, even though many detractors on Reddit have bashed the trading platform for a variety of reasons including its temporary ban on customers buying GameStop (GME) stock earlier this year.\"The platform that powered the meme stock movement has itself become a meme stock — sometimes to Robinood\\'s benefit and sometimes to its detriment,\" said Jonathan Anastas, chairman of Alpha Esports Tech, a mobile gaming firm. So much for the Reddit army of \"apes\" bringing Robinhood to its knees? Perhaps. The company has been credited with — and also criticized for — helping turn investing into something like a game. But Anastas argues Robinhood is simply following the money.\"They appeal to a trader demographic that is focused more on emotion and momentum,\" Anastas said. \"Robinhood is not valued on fundamentals.\" Already on the hunt for acquisitionsStill, Robinhood is now a publicly traded company with a market valuation north of $45 billion and it\\'s looking to grow its business quickly — just like Facebook did before it.The platform announced Tuesday that it is buying Say Technologies, an online shareholder communications platform geared towards individual investors, for $140 million in cash.\"Like Robinhood, Say was built on the belief that everyone should have the same access to the financial markets as Wall Street insiders,\" Aparna Chennapragrada, Robinhood\\'s chief product officer, wrote in a blog post.\"We share a common goal of eliminating the barriers that keep people from participating in our financial system,\" she added.The fact that Robinhood is looking to make an acquisition so soon after its IPO is also similar to a big deal Facebook pulled off back in 2012, just before it went public: Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, a deal that some felt was too pricey at the time.Facebook, like Robinhood, also struggled out of the gate. In fact, it was an even bigger IPO flop as shares plunged about 50% below their IPO price in the first few months of trading before bottoming out.But CEO Mark Zuckerberg wound up having the last laugh. The Instagram acquisition helped Facebook become a bigger player in mobile and allowed it to attract even more of the young users advertisers covet. Nine years after its \"failed\" IPO, Facebook is now worth more than $1 trillion.Plenty of competition in fintech and from Wall StreetIt\\'s hardly a given, however, that Robinhood is on track for a similar surge by 2030. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, like Zuckerberg, will need to stay on top of market trends to get even bigger.\"Robinhood has had a lot of naysayers but they\\'ve amassed millions of account holders and the marching orders are clear,\" said Michael Kamerman, CEO of Skilling, an online brokerage firm. \"I think Vlad wants to attract even higher net worth clients.\" Robinhood will also need to fend off a large swath of competition over the next decade.Rival online trading firms ae gunning for Robinhood, including Webull and eToro, which is in the process of merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) so it too can go public.Meanwhile financial giants Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are courting retail traders more aggressively too, thanks to their respective acquisitions of online brokers TD Ameritrade and E-Trade. With that in mind, Robinhood could also one day wind up as a juicy takeover target for a larger financial firm that would probably love to get access to Robinhood\\'s younger customer base.\"Wealth has moved from boomers and Gen X to millennials and Gen Z,\" Anasta said. \"Younger investors have different preferences.\"',\n",
       " 'A vulnerability in Poly Network allowed the thief to make off with the funds, the platform said Tuesday, begging the attacker to return the money. \"The amount of money you hacked is the biggest one in the defi history,\" Poly Network wrote in a letter to the attacker it posted to Twitter. \"The money you stole are from tens of thousands of crypto community members... you should talk to us to work out a solution.\"Poly Network urged other members of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to \"blacklist\" the assets coming from addresses used by the attacker to siphon away the funds — which included a mix of various coins including $33 million of Tether, according to Tether\\'s CTO. The cryptocurrency exchange Binance said it was \"coordinating with all our security partners to actively help.\" Poly Network links together the blockchains of multiple virtual currencies to create interoperability among them. Following the hack, Poly Network established several addresses to which it said the attacker could return the money. And it appears the hacker is cooperating: As of 7:47 a.m. ET Wednesday, Poly Network said, it had received about $4.7 million back. It was not immediately clear who was behind the hack or why the money is being returned. Regulators have increased their scrutiny of crypto platforms as investors pour billions of dollars into digital currencies. Senator Elizabeth Warren recently asked SEC Chair Gary Gensler to investigate the SEC\\'s ability to oversee trading on crypto platforms.In response, last week, Gensler said: \"Right now, I believe investors using these platforms are not adequately protected.\"',\n",
       " 'Today, one of the most common questions I hear from business leaders is: \"What can my organization do to help people through this change?\" We\\'ve all been hit with so much change over the past year and a half that people at all levels have been jolted into rethinking their priorities. We\\'re all asking hard questions about how we spend our time at home and at work. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, there are ways organizations can be more understanding and foster an environment where their people can thrive.Here\\'s how:Focus on well-beingWe seem to be in a \"great awakening\" when it comes to mental health, but well-being doesn\\'t just mean \"not ill.\" It means feeling confident, optimistic and able to show up fully in your work and life every day. When we\\'re mentally fit, we have the energy, grace and space to grow and reconnect with everything we love about life. Suboptimal mental health, even if it doesn\\'t reach the level of clinical mental illness, can still have far-reaching, disruptive effects. Our research shows that 55% of the workforce is languishing, or feeling stuck. However, when employees who are languishing feel supported, their productivity can improve. As leaders, we can buffer the impact of suffering and prevent burnout before it even gets to that point. Leaders should reframe work to intentionally provide meaning and purpose. When workers feel that their work is highly meaningful, they are less likely to want to leave their jobs. During the early months of the pandemic, BetterUp donated coaching to health care workers. Supporting those on the frontlines deeply impacted our employees, who were personally experiencing stress, anxiety and change. Our team found a renewed sense of purpose and positivity even with this additional workload, and this helped to transform morale and performance internally. Walk the talk One surefire way to disengage employees is if the organization\\'s stated values don\\'t match up with the day-to-day experience of working there. If we as leaders say that we care about managing burnout, fostering inclusivity and investing in people\\'s growth, we need to put policies in place that show those goals are prioritized. A company that says it is focused on productivity shouldn\\'t embrace a culture of meeting-heavy days that don\\'t accommodate for downtime. For example, at BetterUp we\\'re all about prioritizing personal growth, so we have four paid \"Inner Work\" days each year when we all step away to spend the day unplugging in nature, taking a class or spending time with loved ones. Additionally, employees get five paid days a year for volunteering. Giving back to others is sometimes the best way to reconnect with ourselves.Reimagine the role of the middle managerSo much of the conversation has been centered around the hybrid, remote or in-person work model, but the truth is that if you\\'ve been building a company in the last 10 years, this has been something we\\'d all eventually have to face — with or without a pandemic. In a knowledge economy, location doesn\\'t matter as much as having managers who can create a locus of inclusion, culture and performance. With remote work, managers no longer have the ability to use in-person cues like seeing someone at their desk or seeing them working late at the office to be able to tell if they\\'re working hard. So we have to change the role that middle management plays as they wear multiple hats of leader, project manager, coach and, increasingly, even something akin to a \"therapist\" to their teams.Mid-level managers, who typically lead two-thirds of an organization, have a disproportionate influence on the organization\\'s culture. It\\'s crucial to enable middle management to be the catalysts for positive organizational change — whether it\\'s through targeted development programs or through improving lines of communication. We need to equip people managers to be stewards of our values, and empower them to create those boundaries for themselves and their teams.Avoid the echo-chamberIf we learned anything from this last year, it\\'s that you can\\'t just replicate your company\\'s old policies in a new environment. In-person processes don\\'t map directly onto a fully remote world. The most successful organizations created new practices that took advantage of the possibilities afforded by virtual environments.Chevron, for example, offered Coaching Circles, which are group coaching experiences led by a BetterUp coach. With Coaching Circles, Chevron was able to support 7,000 employees from around the world with highly relevant topics — like resilience, peak productivity and finding balance — even during the height of the pandemic. (CNN is also a client of BetterUp.)There obviously won\\'t be one right answer that will please everyone, but by listening to a diversity of perspectives, you can avoid an echo-chamber that will only alienate your workforce. We know that not feeling in control is one of the major causes of burnout. As executives redesign work for a post-pandemic world, one of the most important things they can do is to approach redesigning work in a way that invites their employees to participate, thereby bolstering their sense of agency and control in the work environment. Ultimately, the pandemic reinforced the importance of talking with people — not talking at them. Honoring the humanity of your people and taking their perspectives to heart can make a workplace where people are empowered and have the agency to co-create the organizational culture. If you speak openly about well-being, listen to your team\\'s needs, and then take concrete action to address what they tell you, you\\'ll be well on your way to not just weathering this pandemic but emerging on the other side better and stronger.

       "['Deliveroo has said demand for its services has strengthened despite Covid restrictions easing.The food delivery firm saw orders double to 148.8 million in the first half of this year, while the value of its transactions also doubled.At the same time, it narrowed its pre-tax losses to Â£104.8m, as against Â£128.4m a year earlier.It was the first set of results from the company since it floated on the stock market in March.Deliveroo initially listed on the London stock exchange at 390p a share, but the price fell sharply on the opening day of trading, 31 March.On Monday, its shares rallied on the news that German rival Delivery Hero had bought a 5% stake in the company worth Â£284m.But in Wednesday trading, it was down 3.3% at 351p.Cooped-up consumers flocked to order from Deliveroo during the earlier stages of the pandemic, when restaurants were closed and people switched to home deliveries.The firm said it expected customer behaviour to moderate later in the year, but it remained \"excited about the opportunity ahead\".It added that its outlook for the remainder of the year continued to be \"optimistic but prudent, combining confidence in continued year-on-year growth in orders with an expectation that average order values revert towards pre-pandemic levels\".Deliveroo said its gross transaction value for the six months was Â£3.4bn, a 99% rise from the same period in 2020. It repeated an earlier forecast that gross transaction value for the whole of 2021 would be 50% to 60% up on last year.Founder and chief executive Will Shu said: \"We are seeing strong growth and engagement across our marketplace as lockdowns continue to ease. \"Demand has been high amongst consumers. We have widened our consumer base, seen people continuing to order frequently and we now work with more food merchants than any other platform in the UK. \"At the same time, more riders are choosing to continue to work with the company because they value the work we offer.\"By Rob Young, business correspondentFood delivery companies have been some of the standout winners of the pandemic. With people cooped up at home and dining in restaurants banned, a takeaway was for many the highlight of the lockdown week. Some analysts have questioned how much of that surge in business will persist as restaurants reopen. Interestingly, Deliveroo says orders are \"proving resilient\" since the re-emergence of the hospitality industry. But it doesn\\'t expect that to remain the case forever. There are warnings that consumer behaviour \"may moderate\" later in the year and that the value (but not necessarily the number) of orders will return \"towards\" pre-pandemic levels. The company has diversified, though - it now delivers groceries from the likes of Waitrose, Co-op and Aldi. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has described Deliveroo as a \"true British tech success story\". By many measures, it is. But it\\'s not yet a financial success. Despite the huge increase in business over the past year, Deliveroo still didn\\'t make a profit. Its losses were smaller than a year ago, but the company ended the first half Â£104.8m in the red. Investors - who were lukewarm on the company\\'s shares when they started trading in March - may be wondering: if Deliveroo can\\'t make a profit when eating in restaurants isn\\'t allowed, when can it?Deliveroo said it now covered 72% of the UK population. This was ahead of its plans, which had envisaged 67% coverage by the end of this year.In all, it operates in 11 countries, including Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.However, it said it had now decided to pull out of Spain, because \"achieving a top-tier market position would require a disproportionate level of investment with highly uncertain long-term potential returns\".The move comes after the Spanish government announced plans to give more employment rights to workers at food delivery firms and other online services.\"Deliveroo appears to be dominating the takeaway scene in many towns and cities, where its distinctive mint green-jacketed riders operate, despite Uber Eats and Just Eat rivals breathing down their neck,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\"But investors appeared to have lost a little appetite for shares in early trading, with the company expecting customer behaviour to moderate later in the year.\"She added: \"There is speculation growing that Deliveroo could potentially be a target for takeover, given the rush of acquisitions in the British market.\"',\n",
       " 'Amazon has said it will compensate customers who suffer injury or property damage from defective goods sold by independent sellers on its US platform. From 1 September it will pay valid claims of up to $1,000 (Â£720), which make up more than 80% of injury and damage cases on its site, it said. It may also cover claims for higher amounts if sellers are \"unresponsive\".It comes as the shopping giant faces mounting pressure over product safety, following a series of court cases.In July, Amazon was sued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission in an effort to force it to recall hundreds of thousands of goods.These included faulty carbon monoxide detectors, appliances without sufficient protection against electric shocks, and children\\'s clothing that did not meet fire standards. More than half of the goods sold on Amazon now come via third-party vendors, but they are largely unvetted before being sold. For years, consumers have tried to hold the shopping giant to account over faulty products sold by third parties, but the firm has maintained sellers themselves are responsible - a position which has been backed by most courts. However, that has started to change in recent years following a series of high-profile court cases. In 2019, a Federal court in Philadelphia ruled that a woman blinded by a seller\\'s retractable dog lead could restart her legal case against Amazon.She had initially wanted to sue the Nevada-based merchant but had been unable to track them down.In a blog posting, Amazon said it would use its \"advanced fraud and abuse detection systems\", as well as independent insurance fraud experts, to identify valid claims. It said this would save sellers time, money, and better protect customers. \"By standing behind customers and the products in our store, regardless of who sells them, Amazon is going far beyond our legal obligations and what any other marketplace service provider is doing today to protect customers,\" the company said.The firm also announced Amazon Insurance Accelerator, a network of insurance providers that sellers can access if they choose, and an updated policy requiring more merchants to obtain product liability insurance. The policies will launched in the US first before being rolled out elsewhere. ',\n",
       " 'There has been a rise in jobs that advertise working from home compared with before the Covid pandemic, recruitment firm Reed has told the BBC. Prior to the pandemic, 1% of recruitment firm Reed\\'s job vacancies advertised remote working, but this rose to 5% in 2021.Many office workers shifted to flexible working during coronavirus lockdowns.Reed said applications for jobs with remote working shot up, and outpaced the number of vacancies.But the number of flexible working adverts peaked at the beginning of the year, Reed said.Jobs advertising \"dynamic\" or \"hybrid\" working - that is, where people work from home some of the time - also increased at the start of the pandemic, as did applications for them.Since then, the percentage of jobs advertising hybrid working has dropped from 9.2% in January to 5.6% in July.Reed said that this could indicate that employers have not fully embraced flexible working as a permanent feature.But it could be that dynamic working has now become more widely accepted, and companies may not advertise it, just telling people about it at interview. The recruiter also said there have been lots of adverts for roles where people need to be working \"in person\"  in recent months as lockdown restrictions ease in industries such as retail, transport and logistics, as well as health and medicine sectors.Chris Adcock, managing director of Reed Technology, said: \"During the pandemic we were forced into home working, and everyone got a bit of a taste for it, and really understood the benefit it could have in their lives.\"We\\'ve seen people are twice as likely to apply for a job if it\\'s advertised as remote,\" he said.The push for home working is largely coming from younger workers, he added, although \"water cooler moments\" at the office benefit people\\'s careers.His remarks echo those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week told LinkedIn News he doubted he would have done as well if he had started his working life virtually.The pros and cons of working from home and returning to the office has been a hot topic as the UK emerges from the pandemic. Early in June, Apple staff launched a campaign to push back against CEO Tim Cook\\'s plans to bring all employees back into the office by early September.Reed competitor CV-Library, an independent jobs board, also told the BBC the number of roles offering remote working rose between March and July in 2021, compared to 2020.\"Working from home is here to stay and jobseekers are starting to expect flexible working as the norm,\" said its managing director Matthew Moore.\"If companies want to attract and retain top talent, they need to get on board or will risk losing out on the best candidates on the market.\"Jenny Elliott is a copywriter at children\\'s toy company, Capikooa. She says she was attracted to the job after graduating last July because it offered flexible working options.The firm is based in the south of England, while Jenny is based in the north. \"What was key was the remote learning and working - so it was open to people who don\\'t live near them, which was ideal. I could get trained, and work, entirely from home despite the business being physically in Cambridge,\" she says.\"With remote working, I can control the distractions around me and create the ideal environment, which you can\\'t really do in an office. I like working in a quiet space by myself, it takes a lot of pressure off really.\"Jenny says she\\'d like to continue working in this way.\"I\\'m quite used to it - and although I\\'ve never worked in an office, I\\'ve really enjoyed my remote working experience.\"Technology giant Cisco is rolling out a hybrid working plan that has no mandates for how often employees go into the office.The firm now expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week.Francine Katsoudas, the chief people, policy and purpose officer at Cisco, said: \"It\\'s going to be a big change for us.\"\"Despite the fact that we are a global company, that we have collaboration technology, and that we have a culture of flexibility, this is a big shift, because now all of our employees will be working hybrid, and it\\'s not the exception any more,\" she said.\"We have to change the way we meet, and the way that we work.\"Teams and managers will make decisions about whether or not they need be in the office as a team on the same day, she added.',\n",
       " 'Hackers have stolen some $600m (Â£433m) in what appears to be one the largest cryptocurrency heists ever. Blockchain site Poly Network said hackers had exploited a vulnerability in its system and taken thousands of digital tokens such as Ether. In a letter posted on Twitter, it urged the thieves to \"establish communication and return the hacked assets\". In scale, the hack is on par with huge recent breaches at exchanges such as Coincheck and Mt Gox.In its letter Poly Network said: \"The amount of money you have hacked is one of the biggest in defi [decentralised finance] history.\"Law enforcement in any country will regard this as a major economic crime and you will be pursued. \"The money you stole are [sic] from tens of thousands of crypto community members, hence the people.\" Poly Network said a preliminary investigation found a hacker exploited a \"vulnerability between contract calls\". It urged various exchanges to block deposits of the coins, after millions of dollars in tokens were transferred to separate cryptocurrency wallets.About $267m of Ether currency has been taken, $252m of Binance coins and roughly $85 million in USDC tokens. Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, said his firm was aware of the hack, but added there was only so much he could do. He said the group was \"co-ordinating with all our security partners to proactively help\".\"There are no guarantees,\" he added.Poly Network is a decentralised finance - or Defi - provider, which allows users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network.Cryptocurrency systems such as Ether and Binance were developed independently, so have struggled to work in conjunction with each other. Losses from fraud in the Defi sector hit an all-time high of $474m in the first seven months of the year, a report from research company CipherTrace said on Tuesday.But losses from crime in the overall cryptocurrency market dropped sharply to $681m, compared to $1.9bn for the whole of 2020 and $4.5bn in 2019.Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Defi lender Blockchain Credit Partners and two of its top executives for raising $30m through allegedly fraudulent offerings. The case is the SEC\\'s first involving securities in the Defi space.',\n",
       " 'Chinese technology giant Xiaomi has said it plans to be the world\\'s biggest smartphone maker within three years.The comments by the Beijing-based firm\\'s boss come after it recently overtook Apple to become the second largest mobile brand.South Korea\\'s Samsung Electronics currently holds the number one spot.Xiaomi\\'s founder and chief executive Lei Jun was speaking ahead of the launch of the company\\'s new Mix 4 handset.\"Our current task is to cement the number two position in the global market,\" Mr Lei said, adding: \"We aim to become global number one in three years.\"He was making his annual speech during an online event as the company celebrated the 10th anniversary of its first smartphone launch.Industry figures released last month showed that Xiaomi had for the first time overtaken US rival Apple as the world\\'s second-biggest smartphone brand.Xiaomi accounted for almost 17% of the global handset market in the April to June quarter, topping Apple\\'s 14.1%, according to research firm IDC.For the same period Samsung saw its market share shrink to 18.8% but held on to the number one position.Like several other major Chinese technology firms, Xiaomi was accused by Donald Trump\\'s administration of being a threat to US national security.At the start of the year it was blacklisted by the US Department of Defense over claims that it had ties with the China\\'s military.In May, a US federal judge blocked the enforcement of an investment ban on Xiaomi, calling the decision to blacklist it as \"deeply flawed\".Had the ban gone ahead Xiaomi would have been removed from US stock exchanges and global benchmark shares indexes.Mr Lei\\'s speech came ahead of the launch of a wide range of new Xiaomi devices, including the Mix 4 smartphone, its latest television, tablet computer and smart speaker.It also unveiled a \\'CyberDog\\' four-legged robot, which it described as its \"first foray into quadruped robotics for the open source community and developers worldwide.\"The company invited robotics enthusiasts and \"other like-minded Xiaomi Fans\" to help develop the project.Earlier this year, Xiaomi announced plans to invest $10bn (Â£7.2bn) over the next decade to develop electric vehicles.The move sees it enter another fiercely competitive sector, with hundreds of companies in China already battling for a share of the global electric vehicle market.',\n",
       " 'People in England are no longer being asked to work from home. Instead the Prime Minister Boris Johnson is recommending a \"gradual return to work\".However, in the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep working at home where possible. Employers in England were able to start planning for staff who have been able to work from home during the pandemic to return to the workplace after Covid restrictions were lifted on 19 July.The government wants to help companies which have struggled during lockdown, such as those in city centres which rely on office staff. It\\'s also keen to cut the cost of paying furloughed staff by encouraging businesses to reopen.Most of the Covid restrictions in Scotland were lifted on 9 August as the country moved beyond the level zero rules which had been in place since 19 July.Physical distancing rules and the limits on gatherings have been removed, and all venues are allowed to reopen.However, the Scottish government is continuing to advise people to work from home where possible as part of a \"gradual approach\" to returning to offices. Most Covid restrictions in Wales were lifted on 7 August. Limits on meeting others have been removed, and all businesses can reopen. However, individual businesses - including offices and places open to the public such as pubs and restaurants - must carry out Covid risk assessments, and minimise the risk of coronavirus exposure to staff or customers, or face enforcement action.The Welsh government is also still advising that people should continue to work from home wherever possible. The Northern Ireland executive is expected to consider whether to update its guidance around working from home at its next meeting on 12 August. You can ask, but your employer doesn\\'t have to agree. However, the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) - which represents HR professionals - says there could be much greater freedom and flexibility in how, when and where people work in future.\"People generally want a mix of workplace and home working, and the possibility of more choice in their working routines, meaning hybrid working can provide an effective balance for many workers.\"The CIPD adds that the lifting of Covid restrictions \"shouldn\\'t signal a mass return to workplaces,\" and \"it should be down to individual organisations, consulting with their people, to agree working arrangements\".Despite the removal of Covid restrictions in England, businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to those affected by their business. The government\\'s Working Safely guidance still recommends that employers carry out health-and-safety risk assessments, and take reasonable steps to minimise the risks identified. Some businesses may choose to keep some of the measures they previously had in place, such as:The legal requirement to wear a face covering in England has ended. But government guidance says it \"expects and recommends\" the continued wearing of masks in crowded areas such as public transport.Masks remain compulsory on public transport and in certain other circumstances in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Regular lateral flow testing for Covid is already widespread in many sectors, and anyone in England or Scotland can also order tests directly.There\\'s more detailed guidance for specific industries including construction, hospitality and manufacturing. Similar advice is available for employers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.If employees feel unsafe, they can contact their local authority, Citizens Advice or the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE has carried more than 200,000 inspections to check companies are following Covid rules, and can force firms to take action if not. The CIPD says that employers should continue to ensure they have the necessary measures in place to give confidence to workers that their workplace is safe. \"This can include changes to desk spaces, shift patterns to help workers avoid busy times on public transport and use of one-way systems to reduce staff contact while the risk of infection remains,\" it says.Much of the risk depends on how crowded it is, and your distance from other people.Wearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible.Previous advice that millions of \"clinically extremely vulnerable\" people should shield, has now ended.Many continue to work from home, but if your job cannot be done remotely, your employer can ask you to return to the workplace. However, they still have a responsibility to keep you safe, so you should raise any specific concerns you have about going back. In addition, if you are disabled, your employer has an extra responsibility to make and pay for \"reasonable adjustments\".',\n",
       " 'Google employees in the US who opt to work from home permanently may get a pay cut.The technology giant has developed a pay calculator that lets employees see the effects of working remotely or moving offices.Some remote employees, especially those with a long commute, could have their pay cut without changing address.Google has no plans at this time to implement the policy in the UK.Employees in many businesses have proved that working from home permanently is viable during the Covid pandemic.Many companies are looking ahead to how employees will work as the pandemic recedes, even as the US continues to battle the Delta variant of the disease.Silicon Valley firms, some of which are keen to get employees back to their desks, are experimenting with employee pay structures.Big tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter have offered less pay for employees based in locations where it is more inexpensive to live.But smaller firms such as Reddit and Zillow have said they will pay the same no matter where employees are based, saying that this improves diversity.A Google spokesperson said: \"Our compensation packages have always been determined by location, and we always pay at the top of the local market based on where an employee works from.\"Our new Work Location Tool was developed to help employees make informed decisions about which city or state they work from and any impact on compensation if they choose to relocate or work remotely.\" One Google employee, who works in Seattle but has a two-hour commute, complained to Reuters of being faced with a 10% pay cut for choosing to work from home full-time. \"It\\'s as high a pay cut as I got for my most recent promotion,\" the employee said. \"I didn\\'t do all that hard work to get promoted to then take a pay cut.\"Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said Google\\'s move raises alarms about who will feel the impact most acutely, including families.\"What\\'s clear is that Google doesn\\'t have to do this,\" Prof Rosenfeld said. \"Google has paid these workers at 100% of their prior wage, by definition. So it\\'s not like they can\\'t afford to pay their workers who choose to work remotely the same that they are used to receiving.\"A Google employee in Stamford, Connecticut, which is an hour away from New York by train, would be paid 15% less working remotely, while there were 5% and 10% differences in the Seattle, Boston and San Francisco areas.Google will not change employees\\' pay if they work fully remotely from the same city.In the UK, it\\'s a fundamental part of employment law that employers cannot alter aspects of contracts such as rates of pay without the consent of employees, or without terminating those contracts and renegotiating them, said Emma Bartlett, a partner at employment lawyers CM Murray.From an employee perspective, it would be demoralising to be paid less for doing the same job, she said, and from a business perspective, it would have the potential to create two tiers of employment, with some employees expected to be in the office, and some not.If people stayed home working for childcare reasons, and women continue to take the main responsibility for childcare, then this could have the effect of widening the gender pay gap, she said.Workers may be treated differently in other respects, she added, and organisations would have to work hard to make sure employees were not treated differently in terms of training, promotion, and access to clients.Some businesses, such as US technology giant Cisco, have put in place a hybrid working plan that has no mandates about how often employees go into the office.Cisco expects that less than a quarter of its workforce will want to be in an office for three or more days a week.But other firms, such as Goldman Sachs, want workers to return to offices.The investment bank\\'s boss, David Solomon, said in February that working from home was \"an aberration\" rather than \"the new normal\".The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents human resource professionals in the UK, said it was always \"the safest option\" for firms to seek express written agreement from employees before changing the level of their pay.In its guidance to employers, it says that imposing a pay cut is a \"high-risk\" approach, since workers can bring claims for breach of contract or even constructive unfair dismissal.']"

       "'The company on Monday said it has fired an employee after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who also works at Alibaba (BABA). The man confessed to actions that Alibaba deemed \"in serious violation of company policy,\" according to a memo sent by Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang to employees.Two senior employees also resigned after they \"failed to prioritize employee protection,\" according to Zhang\\'s memo.\"Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba\\'s top priority,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business.The allegations — which were widely circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend — have rocked Alibaba at a time when it and other Chinese tech companies are already facing incredible scrutiny from Chinese regulators over their business. The claims triggered public outcry as many criticized the company for its handling of the situation. The controversy started after a post — allegedly written by the victim, who did not identify herself, and published on an internal Alibaba website — circulated on the Chinese social media website Weibo. According to screenshots of the 8,000-word account, the woman claimed she was assaulted by her supervisor during a business trip to Jinan, a city in eastern China, while she says she was drunk. \"The male leader even entered my hotel room four times that night with condom and assaulted me!!!! When I typed the lines above, I couldn\\'t control myself, and I broke into tears. I never thought that I would have such an experience,\" she wrote. \"When I think about it now, it just feels like a nightmare, one that makes you terrified, scared, helpless, helpless nightmare!\"CNN Business cannot confirm the authenticity of the post.The post has exploded on Chinese social media. Topics related to the incident have been viewed 850 million times on Weibo, generating more than 510,000 discussion posts. Some commenters accused Alibaba of failing to protect the rights of its employees. The woman allegedly claimed that the company brushed off her concerns when she reported them.\"How come there are still female employees who have been pushed and pressured by their leaders to drink and are violated. Is this the Alibaba culture?\" wrote one Weibo user. \"I really hope the results of the investigation can become clear as soon as possible. Such a large company must protect its employees.\"On Sunday, police in Jinan announced on Weibo that they had launched a probe into the case.\"The police are actively investigating the matter and collecting evidence,\" they said in a statement. The accused has not been charged with any crime. In the memo to employees on Monday, Zhang said the employee confessed to \"intimate acts\" with a woman who was inebriated, violating company policy. \"Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement,\" Zhang added in the memo, which was posted publicly on the company\\'s news website. \"He will be fired and never be rehired,\" Zhang wrote. Two executives, including the president of Alibaba\\'s Neighborhood Retail group, have resigned over the handling of the incident, according to Zhang, who added that the woman reported the incident to the company August 2. \"We believe that the head of the business is both the owner of the business and the team\\'s culture,\" Zhang wrote, adding that when the woman reported \"a horrendous act ... they did not make timely decisions nor took appropriate action.\"\"This incident has caused tremendous harm to her. We will do everything we can to take care of her,\" Zhang wrote.Zhang added that the company\\'s chief people officer has also been reprimanded, and said that the company will establish a dedicated reporting channel for employees, as well as create an \"anti-sexual harassment policy\" that will include input from experts and employees. Zhang also acknowledged that the incident highlights what he called a culture of \"forced drinking,\" referring to alcohol-heavy events that are popular in China to secure business deals or build partnerships.  \"Although the police are still investigating the specific circumstances of the dinner that day, we are staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture,\" he wrote. \"Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or a supervisor, our employees are empowered to reject it.\"The scandal\\'s rapid spread on social media — along with the public outrage that ensued — comes as major firms, including Alibaba, have faced huge regulatory pressure. As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party\\'s dominant role in every aspect of China\\'s economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions.Complaints about work culture play into that scrutiny. Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm and rival to Alibaba, faced intense public backlash earlier this year  over accusations that it overworks its employees after two of its employees died unexpectedly, including a man who died by suicide. Chinese social media users started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture, and a former software engineer at the company escalated criticisms in several posts where he accused the company of overworking its employees. The company did not respond at the time to questions about the allegations made against its work culture, but did say that it had set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of a worker.'"

       "'The company on Monday said it has fired an employee after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who also works at Alibaba (BABA). The man confessed to actions that Alibaba deemed \"in serious violation of company policy,\" according to a memo sent by Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang to employees. Two senior employees also resigned after they \"failed to prioritize employee protection,\" according to Zhang\\'s memo. \"Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba\\'s top priority,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business. The allegations — which were widely circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend — have rocked Alibaba at a time when it and other Chinese tech companies are already facing incredible scrutiny from Chinese regulators over their business. The claims triggered public outcry as many criticized the company for its handling of the situation. The controversy started after a post — allegedly written by the victim, who did not identify herself, and published on an internal Alibaba website — circulated on the Chinese social media website Weibo. According to screenshots of the 8,000-word account, the woman claimed she was assaulted by her supervisor during a business trip to Jinan, a city in eastern China, while she says she was drunk. \"The male leader even entered my hotel room four times that night with condom and assaulted me!!!! When I typed the lines above, I couldn\\'t control myself, and I broke into tears. I never thought that I would have such an experience,\" she wrote. \"When I think about it now, it just feels like a nightmare, one that makes you terrified, scared, helpless, helpless nightmare! \"CNN Business cannot confirm the authenticity of the post. The post has exploded on Chinese social media. Topics related to the incident have been viewed 850 million times on Weibo, generating more than 510,000 discussion posts. Some commenters accused Alibaba of failing to protect the rights of its employees. The woman allegedly claimed that the company brushed off her concerns when she reported them. \"How come there are still female employees who have been pushed and pressured by their leaders to drink and are violated. Is this the Alibaba culture? \" wrote one Weibo user. \"I really hope the results of the investigation can become clear as soon as possible. Such a large company must protect its employees. \"On Sunday, police in Jinan announced on Weibo that they had launched a probe into the case. \"The police are actively investigating the matter and collecting evidence,\" they said in a statement. The accused has not been charged with any crime. In the memo to employees on Monday, Zhang said the employee confessed to \"intimate acts\" with a woman who was inebriated, violating company policy. \"Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement,\" Zhang added in the memo, which was posted publicly on the company\\'s news website. \"He will be fired and never be rehired,\" Zhang wrote. Two executives, including the president of Alibaba\\'s Neighborhood Retail group, have resigned over the handling of the incident, according to Zhang, who added that the woman reported the incident to the company August 2. \"We believe that the head of the business is both the owner of the business and the team\\'s culture,\" Zhang wrote, adding that when the woman reported \"a horrendous act ... they did not make timely decisions nor took appropriate action. \"\"This incident has caused tremendous harm to her. We will do everything we can to take care of her,\" Zhang wrote. Zhang added that the company\\'s chief people officer has also been reprimanded, and said that the company will establish a dedicated reporting channel for employees, as well as create an \"anti-sexual harassment policy\" that will include input from experts and employees. Zhang also acknowledged that the incident highlights what he called a culture of \"forced drinking,\" referring to alcohol-heavy events that are popular in China to secure business deals or build partnerships.  \"Although the police are still investigating the specific circumstances of the dinner that day, we are staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture,\" he wrote. \"Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or a supervisor, our employees are empowered to reject it. \"The scandal\\'s rapid spread on social media — along with the public outrage that ensued — comes as major firms, including Alibaba, have faced huge regulatory pressure. As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party\\'s dominant role in every aspect of China\\'s economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions. Complaints about work culture play into that scrutiny. Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm and rival to Alibaba, faced intense public backlash earlier this year  over accusations that it overworks its employees after two of its employees died unexpectedly, including a man who died by suicide. Chinese social media users started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture, and a former software engineer at the company escalated criticisms in several posts where he accused the company of overworking its employees. The company did not respond at the time to questions about the allegations made against its work culture, but did say that it had set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of a worker.'"

      "The company on Monday said it has fired an employee after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman who also works at Alibaba (BABA).\n",
      "\n",
      "The man confessed to actions that Alibaba deemed in serious violation of company policy, according to a memo sent by Alibaba Group chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang to employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two senior employees also resigned after they failed to prioritize employee protection, according to Zhang's memo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba's top priority, a company spokesperson said in a statement to CNN Business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The allegations — which were widely circulated on Chinese social media over the weekend — have rocked Alibaba at a time when it and other Chinese tech companies are already facing incredible scrutiny from Chinese regulators over their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The claims triggered public outcry as many criticized the company for its handling of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The controversy started after a post — allegedly written by the victim, who did not identify herself, and published on an internal Alibaba website — circulated on the Chinese social media website Weibo.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to screenshots of the 8,000-word account, the woman claimed she was assaulted by her supervisor during a business trip to Jinan, a city in eastern China, while she says she was drunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The male leader even entered my hotel room four times that night with condom and assaulted me!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I typed the lines above, I couldn't control myself, and I broke into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought that I would have such an experience, she wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I think about it now, it just feels like a nightmare, one that makes you terrified, scared, helpless, helpless nightmare!\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN Business cannot confirm the authenticity of the post.\n",
      "\n",
      "The post has exploded on Chinese social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topics related to the incident have been viewed 850 million times on Weibo, generating more than 510,000 discussion posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some commenters accused Alibaba of failing to protect the rights of its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman allegedly claimed that the company brushed off her concerns when she reported them.\n",
      "\n",
      "How come there are still female employees who have been pushed and pressured by their leaders to drink and are violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this the Alibaba culture?\n",
      "\n",
      "wrote one Weibo user.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really hope the results of the investigation can become clear as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a large company must protect its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, police in Jinan announced on Weibo that they had launched a probe into the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police are actively investigating the matter and collecting evidence, they said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The accused has not been charged with any crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the memo to employees on Monday, Zhang said the employee confessed to intimate acts with a woman who was inebriated, violating company policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he has committed rape or indecency that violates the law will be determined by law enforcement, Zhang added in the memo, which was posted publicly on the company's news website.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will be fired and never be rehired, Zhang wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two executives, including the president of Alibaba's Neighborhood Retail group, have resigned over the handling of the incident, according to Zhang, who added that the woman reported the incident to the company August 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that the head of the business is both the owner of the business and the team's culture, Zhang wrote, adding that when the woman reported a horrendous act ... they did not make timely decisions nor took appropriate action.\n",
      "\n",
      "This incident has caused tremendous harm to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will do everything we can to take care of her, Zhang wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang added that the company's chief people officer has also been reprimanded, and said that the company will establish a dedicated reporting channel for employees, as well as create an anti-sexual harassment policy that will include input from experts and employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zhang also acknowledged that the incident highlights what he called a culture of forced drinking, referring to alcohol-heavy events that are popular in China to secure business deals or build partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the police are still investigating the specific circumstances of the dinner that day, we are staunchly opposed to the ugly forced drinking culture, he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or a supervisor, our employees are empowered to reject it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scandal's rapid spread on social media — along with the public outrage that ensued — comes as major firms, including Alibaba, have faced huge regulatory pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "As President Xi Jinping increasingly emphasizes the ruling Communist Party's dominant role in every aspect of China's economy and society, regulators have targeted tech, education and other businesses with fines and restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complaints about work culture play into that scrutiny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pinduoduo, an e-commerce firm and rival to Alibaba, faced intense public backlash earlier this year  over accusations that it overworks its employees after two of its employees died unexpectedly, including a man who died by suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chinese social media users started calling out the deaths as emblematic of a troublesome work culture, and a former software engineer at the company escalated criticisms in several posts where he accused the company of overworking its employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company did not respond at the time to questions about the allegations made against its work culture, but did say that it had set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of a worker.\n",
